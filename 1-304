Too much strain.  
It says, when you  
don’t break a rule,  
you must do good.  

Duties can weigh  
on you in a  
way that feels hard.  
These rules won’t make  
you hurt or give.  

These claims look at  
what costs you bear,  
not what’s on them.  
If you must die  
to save two lives,  
that cost is yours.  

So, how much strain  
does right ask of  
those in its grip?  
Must you make all  
that is good grow?
