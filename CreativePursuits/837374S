**DECLARATION OF JURISDICTION AND ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF FACTS**

**I, JUSTIN DAVID M,** HEREBY DECLARE THE FOLLOWING FACTS AND PERSONAL PERCEPTIONS REGARDING THE CONCEPTS OF DIVINE TRUTH, HUMAN FORM, AND SPIRITUAL UNDERSTANDING. I PRESENT THIS DECLARATION UNDER THE LIGHT OF CHRIST AS MY WITNESS, ACKNOWLEDGING THAT MY FATHER IS JOHN.

**FACTS:**

1. **FOUNDATIONAL TRUTH:** THE INTRINSIC VALUE OF EVERY INDIVIDUAL IS GROUNDED IN DIVINE CREATION AND THE TEACHINGS OF CHRIST.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

2. **HISTORICAL CONTEXT OF HORUFISM:** HORUFISM, AS ARTICULATED BY FAZL-ALLĀH, EXPLORES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LETTERS, SOUND, AND THE HUMAN FORM, EMBODYING A SPIRITUAL TRUTH THAT CONNECTS LANGUAGE TO DIVINE MEANING.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

3. **SIGNIFICANCE OF THE JĀVDĀN-NĀMA:** THE JĀVDĀN-NĀMA IS A CRUCIAL TEXT THAT OFFERS INSIGHT INTO DIVINE REVELATION AND THE HUMAN CONDITION, BRIDGING SPIRITUAL UNDERSTANDING ACROSS GENERATIONS.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

4. **PROFOUND SIGNIFICANCE OF KORANIC LETTERS:** THE LETTERS OF THE KORAN ARE MORE THAN MERE SOUNDS; THEY REFLECT DEEPER TRUTHS ABOUT EXISTENCE AND SPIRITUALITY, ENCOMPASSING THE ESSENCE OF HUMAN EXPERIENCE.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

**PERSONAL OPINIONS/PERCEPTIONS:**

1. **INTERPRETATION OF HORUFISM:** MY PERCEPTION THAT HORUFISM PROVIDES A UNIQUE LENS THROUGH WHICH TO VIEW THE CONNECTION BETWEEN LANGUAGE AND SPIRITUAL TRUTH IS AN INTERPRETATION OF ITS HISTORICAL CONTEXT.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED AS A SUBJECTIVE INTERPRETATION.*

2. **CYCLES OF REVELATION:** THE UNDERSTANDING THAT PROPHECIES AND SPIRITUAL INSIGHTS OCCUR IN CYCLICAL PATTERNS REFLECTS A PERSPECTIVE ON THE CONTINUITY OF DIVINE GUIDANCE THROUGH TIME.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED AS A SUBJECTIVE ASSESSMENT.*

3. **DIVINE GUIDANCE IN MODERN UNDERSTANDING:** MY VIEW THAT INDIVIDUAL EXPERIENCES AND PERCEPTIONS OF DIVINE TRUTH CONTRIBUTE TO A COLLECTIVE UNDERSTANDING OF SPIRITUALITY IS AN EXPRESSION OF MY BELIEFS.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED AS A PERSONAL PERSPECTIVE.*

4. **HUMAN FORM AND SPIRITUAL SIGNIFICANCE:** THE BELIEF THAT THE HUMAN FORM REFLECTS DIVINE TRUTHS, SUCH AS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIRTY-TWO TEETH LINKED TO SPIRITUAL UNDERSTANDING, IS A SUBJECTIVE INTERPRETATION OF FAZL-ALLĀH’S THOUGHT.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED AS A SUBJECTIVE INTERPRETATION.*

**CONCLUSION:**

IN LIGHT OF THE FACTS PRESENTED ABOVE AND MY PERSONAL PERCEPTIONS, I AFFIRM THE VALIDITY OF THIS DECLARATION AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THESE OBSERVATIONS ARE MADE IN GOOD FAITH, SEEKING CLARITY AND UNDERSTANDING IN THIS MATTER.
