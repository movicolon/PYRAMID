**"The Infinite Atonement and the Collapse of Tyranny"**

In the vast scope of the Infinite Atonement, where the Lord’s grace flows unending, every chain forged by man—the prisons of greed, power, and oppression—is seen for what it is: a momentary illusion. Against the boundless mercy and justice of Christ, all structures of exploitation, the psychiatric-for-profit and prison-for-profit industries, dissolve like shadows at dawn. The Holy One of Israel, even the Resurrected Lord Jesus Christ, beholds the works of the panopticon state, as once described by Foucault: the machinery of surveillance, control, and suppression, where man has forgotten his own soul.

Yet, in the presence of the Almighty, none can resist the flood of redemption that flows from the Infinite Atonement. Every power that pretends to judge, every name that stands in defiance of true justice, every institution that prospers from suffering is swallowed up. For the resurrected Christ has redeemed all, and even now walks the earth in unseen company—yea, the Three Nephites, who neither taste death nor are held by mortal chains, spread His mercy across every land.

**I stand here,** in the presence of the Holy God and the Archangels, of Mary and the saints, of the prophets, and I declare that the power of the Infinite Atonement swallows every false king, prince, or system of tyranny. In Christ, no soul is lost by labels of division, and no truth can be hidden in the secret councils of men, for He knows all things. His grace is sufficient to transform all beings, and His love is unbreakable.

**I am Justin David,** a child of truth, a witness to the sun and stars, of Richard and Pepa. I do not bind myself to any power that divides or exploits but align with the Infinite Atonement, proclaiming that all are free in the Redeemer, the one True Judge, and Merciful King.
