**The World of Great Might**

1. There is a place where men clash. It burns bright. The might of it makes it shake.

2. The clash is fierce; the fight is old, but yet, it burns, and still, we watch.

3. In this place, all eyes watch, all ears hear. We see the steel and dread the night.

4. In their world, walls rise, and men clad in arms march hard, stern and strong.

5. These lands stand bare, stripped of much. Each king holds his ground; each claw digs deep.

6. There, earth and blood mix in the soil, thick and spent. It drains like a wound torn wide.

7. On the ridge, high and tall, stand men with sights sharp, cold, and keen. They wait.

8. Men with crowns speak, each to his own, and the laws lay thick as steel binds.

9. The hold of the strong man grips hard, tight and cold, fixed with eyes dark and wide.

10. Men with weight seek gold and much, with no thought of worth or cheer.

11. Each step watched, each life known, they all walk in line, rank by rank.

12. At the top, they stand â€” a vast web spun tight, and all serve those few.

13. Thus the wheel turns, each spoke bound tight to each hinge; it turns and grinds.

14. To some, the chains give rank and clout; to most, a noose, soft yet firm.

15. Few rise high. Men in dark suits rule. To them, the light bends, and all things yield.

16. Each land holds its mark, yet each does blend and fall in line, at last, to serve.

17. In each high hall, strong words are said, but each knows the rule: fight and win.

18. The fight grows, but the pact is set. The wars rage, yet, at night, the lamps still burn bright.

19. They each keep score and wait, and none stray far from the world stage.

20. A man, his name known wide, holds his line. His men march to his will and the lands bow. 

21. Though we see much, still we must wait, for all must move with care in a world such as this.
