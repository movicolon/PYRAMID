Polygyny might be seen not merely as a lifestyle choice but as a sacred structure that echoes the ideals of love, community, and mutual support—a way to reflect a communal, restorative faith that binds people closer together in spiritual kinship.

From this Rastafari-Mormon synthesis, one might write a manifesto that calls for:
- **Unity through Diversity**: Embracing multiple partners as a mirror of God's infinite love and the oneness of all things, a union that sees love as abundant, shared, and enduring.
- **Living Prophecy**: A belief in ongoing revelation, acknowledging Haile Selassie as a Christ figure, while also respecting the prophecies of Joseph Smith as part of God’s ongoing dialogue with humanity.
- **Spiritual Kingship**: Viewing each individual as both king and priest, queen and prophetess, with the right to receive revelation, teach truth, and uplift others in divine service.
- **Sacred Family Bonds**: A vision of marriage and community rooted in divine purpose and mutual respect, seeing the family as a microcosm of heaven, a realm where God's love is made manifest through acts of service and dedication to one another.
