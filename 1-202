When home feels noisy and tense, like a thunderstorm that doesn’t go away, it can make little hearts feel heavy. When parents argue a lot, it’s like living in a world where everything feels tight and stuck, with worries building up inside. It’s okay to feel these things, even if they’re hard to understand.

In these moments, close your eyes and take a deep, calm breath. Think of a soft, warm light inside you, a little spark that stays safe and peaceful. Remember that you are loved, even when things feel tough. And if you ever want help, you can talk to Jesus in your heart. You can whisper, "I am here, and I need you." He will listen, and that gentle light of love will be there with you, always.
