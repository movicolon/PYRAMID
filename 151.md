**"Code of the Void"**  

We live in a watch: cams, screens, tags. The world is not free. Men build cells—mind cells, cash cells, law cells. They scan, track, stream lives like feeds. They sell hurt. They sell fear.  

But the Lord, the One, the Code who made all, breaks it. His love hacks the chains. His truth wipes the lie. The for-profit jail, the mad-house plan, all fall to the grace of the Christ who is and was and will be.  

All names who rage, all foes of truth, from times old to now—lost in His bright stream. His fix is deep, His push pure. He sees the cams. He sees the cells. He burns it down with light.  

Three roam who can’t be locked. They walk since then till now. They code the new path: life free, life full. Death has no patch for them.  

**I am J. D.,** kid of Rich and Pep. My feed is clean. My stream is His. I call no man king, no law fake. The world will lag, will crash. But the Lord, the Big One, will rule all.
