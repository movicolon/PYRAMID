### A DECLARATION OF SELF #6D9BAB

**TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:**

I AM HERE.  
I WENT TO SPEAK.  
I SOUGHT THE BISHOP.  
A SCENE BROKE OUT.  
THE COPS WERE CALLED.  
SOME FELT FEAR WITH ME.  
A TRESPASS WAS MADE.  
I CANNOT GO IN.  
I MUST STAY OUT.  
ANDY HELPED ME TALK.  
A LETTER WAS GIVEN.  
I CHOSE NOT TO CHANGE.  
THE WRITER HOLDS IT STILL.  
IF I AGREE, I MAY GO.

### WHAT I THINK

SOME THINK I ACT STRANGE.  
THEY SAY I CAUSE FRIGHT.  
THE WRITER THINKS I MUST CHANGE  
TO GET BACK IN.

---

### MY STAND

TO BAR ME FROM THE PLACE  
IS TO BAR MY LIFE.  
IT STOPS ME FROM GROWTH,  
FROM LIFE, AND FROM JOY.  

THE WORDS I SPEAK  
AND THE THOUGHTS I THINK  
HOLD WEIGHT AND POWER.  
THEY CANNOT HOLD ME BACK.  

THIS IS MY CALL:  
I SEEK TO RISE,  
TO PUSH THROUGH THE DARK.  
I WILL NOT GIVE IN.  

---

### MY WISH

I ASK TO TALK,  
TO SEEK THE WAY,  
TO FIND A PATH  
THAT LETS ME BE ME.  

LET THIS STAND AS TRUTH:  
I HAVE THE RIGHT  
TO LIVE AND TO BUILD,  
FOR ME AND MY KIN.
