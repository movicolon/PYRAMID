**DECLARATION OF THE JURISDICTION OF LIVE LOVE CLAIMANT CURRENCY**

**FOUNDATIONAL PRINCIPLES**:  
In the spirit of boundless charity, the **currency of Live Love Claimant** is an acknowledgment of love and welfare for all within Zion. This currency does not seek the praise or gain of the world but is rooted in the measure of charity as commanded: the sustenance and preservation of the laborer for Zion’s sake, not for personal profit or acclaim.

---

### **1. THE MEASURE OF LABOR AND GAIN**

> “The laborer in Zion shall labor for Zion; for if they labor for money, they shall perish.”  
> &mdash; Proclamation

In this jurisdiction, the **Labor of Zion** is an act of service dedicated to the community’s wholeness, untethered from individual profit motives. **Claimant currency** within this jurisdiction is tendered not as traditional money, but as a symbolic transfer of love, service, and unity. This currency is shared freely, rewarding contributions through acts of kindness, wisdom, and unbreakable bonds.

### **2. PROHIBITION OF PRIESTCRAFT AND SELF-GLORIFICATION**

> “He commandeth that there shall be no priestcrafts … but they seek not the welfare of Zion.”  
> &mdash; Directive

Live Love Claimant Currency is issued only under the principles of **pure charity and humility**, dismissing any act of self-glorification or profiteering. Here, the **only true wealth** lies in the welfare of Zion and the mutual aid of its people. Within this jurisdiction, to labor solely for self-gain or personal elevation is to diminish one’s right to the currency of love and life.

### **3. FREEDOM BEYOND MATERIAL BOUNDS**

> “Crazy as a rocket, there’s nothin' in my pocket, I keep it at the rainbow's end.”  
> &mdash; Oath of Vision

Just as currency here symbolizes the love of Zion, **freedom within this jurisdiction transcends material possession**. Claimants who walk in the spirit of love possess a boundless abundance: a wealth that transcends worldly riches and dwells instead in eternal truths and intangible joys. This is the isness, the unrestricted abundance that is beyond ownership and resides in the heart of each person.

---

### **4. DOCTRINE OF RELEASE FROM BONDAGE**

> “The freedom of freedom! I stand all amazed!”  
> &mdash; Declaration

Under Live Love Claimant Currency, no soul shall be subjected to bondage, whether physical, mental, or spiritual. Within Zion, each participant’s contributions and needs are honored without coercion. We reject doctrines that place individuals in unbreakable hierarchies and affirm that **each person possesses an inherent freedom**. This jurisdiction sees **divine providence** as the highest measure of wealth and liberation.
