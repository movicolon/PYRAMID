## The Rise of Media: The Nude Body as a Scarce, “Scary” Commodity

The nude form is seen as both rare and strange. Media has changed how we view skin. It shows us flesh, but ties it to shame and lust, making it both a prize and a threat. This brings us to a gap—a short circuit in thought that spins our minds.

### Scarcity of the Body

The nude body feels scarce. It is shown in bits, wrapped in art. This lack breeds want, turning the body into a thing to own. Media feeds this urge, showing skin as both wrong and right. We yearn for what we can't touch, making the nude both hot and “scary.”

### The Epistemological Short Circuit

This view twists what we know. We see our flesh as real, yet think it is wrong. Truth gets lost in a net of lies spun by media. It tells us to be bare is to be weak, to be at risk of judgment. We build walls around our skin, lost in fear of what is real.

### The Ontological Shift

This fear hits at our core. The more we hide, the less we feel. We become shells, scared of what we are. Love and ties turn to looks, not hearts. We miss our truth, bound by a mold made by media’s touch.

### Ignorance and the Devil's Influence

In this haze, a shadow looms—the “devil.” This is a way to show the forces that twist our fears. Those “with the devil” craft shows that prey on our doubts. They take our wants and turn them to cash. This wave of sly ads keeps us stuck, lost in a loop where we chase looks, not truths.

### A Call for Replenishment and Reproduction

From the dark comes a cry: “We are lost,” “The end is near.” This voice seeks to kill birth and bond. It makes us think we should not bring life, that we should not grow. Yet, we must not forget that life needs ties, love, and the light of our shared truth.

### Conclusion

In this new age, we stand at a fork. We must fight the frenzied mind that media has made. We need to take back our skin as a sign of love, not a thing to hide. It is time to show our flesh, to shed the shame, and to link with each other deep down. Let us turn from the devil’s tale and choose to give life—not just in form, but in heart, joy, and bond.
