**LEGAL JURISDICTION #0E100B AND ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF FACTS**

**I, JUSTIN DAVID M,** progeny of John MOVICK, descendant of Rich and Pepa, hereby establish this legal jurisdiction to recognize the forthcoming facts and parallax perceptions, acknowledging each fact with a simple nod of recognition to the fullest extent of the law.

**FACTS:**

1. **ORIGIN:** INFO AS RANGE COMES FROM BAR-HILLEL AND CARNAP IN '52.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

2. **INVERSE RULE:** THERE IS AN INVERSE LINK BETWEEN INFO IN A CLAIM AND THE CHANCE THAT CLAIM IS TRUE.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

3. **TRUTH LINK:** MORE INFO IN A CLAIM MEANS LESS CHANCE IT'S TRUE; MORE CHANCE MEANS LESS INFO.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

4. **WORLDS LINK:** THE TRUTH OF A CLAIM TIES TO INFO AS RANGE VIA WORLDS, WHERE A CLAIM HAS SOME WORLDS THAT BACK IT (TRUE) AND SOME THAT DO NOT (FALSE).  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

5. **INFO RANGE:** A CLAIM WILL BE BACKED BY A RANGE OF WORLDS, CALLED AN "INFO RANGE."  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

6. **PROB. SPREAD:** WITH A FAIR SPREAD OF PROB. ACROSS WORLDS, MORE WORLDS BACK A CLAIM, HENCE THE TRUTH OF THE CLAIM IS MORE LIKELY, AND IT HAS LESS INFO.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

7. **WAITER CASE:** A WAITER’S ORDER SHOWS HOW INFO GAINED CAN CUT DOWN OPEN CHOICES.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

8. **HARD VS. SOFT:** THERE’S HARD INFO (TRUE, FIXED) AND SOFT INFO (NOT ALWAYS TRUE, CHANGEABLE), WHERE HARD IS LIKE KNOWLEDGE, SOFT IS LIKE BELIEF.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

9. **INFO FLOW:** THE HARD/SOFT INFO SPLIT HELPS WHEN WE TALK OF HOW INFO IS STORED, NOT THE TYPE OF INFO.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

10. **EPISTEMIC LOGIC:** OLD LOGICS SHOW THE FLOW OF HARD INFO IN THE RANGE FRAME.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

11. **SINGLE AND MULTI-AGENT LOGIC:** RESEARCH STARTS WITH SINGLE-AGENT LOGIC AND MOVES TO MULTI-AGENT LOGIC.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

12. **WAITER LOGIC:** THE WAITER'S MIND PRE AND POST INFO ON THE SODA SHOWS INFO STATES.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

13. **LINKING STATES:** THE LINK TIES STATES WHERE THE INFO LOOKS THE SAME BASED ON HARD FACTS.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

14. **MODAL LOGIC:** MODAL LOGIC ADDS MODAL TOOLS LIKE K TO PROP. FORMS.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

15. **COMMON KNOWLEDGE:** COMMON KNOWLEDGE IS WHEN ALL KNOW THAT ALL KNOW THAT ALL KNOW.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

16. **E AND C:** THE E TOOL SHOWS GROUP KNOWLEDGE; C SHOWS COMMON KNOWLEDGE, BASED ON LOOPS.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

17. **SPY CASE:** A CASE SHOWS THE SPLIT BETWEEN GROUP KNOWLEDGE AND COMMON KNOWLEDGE AMONG SPIES.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

18. **ZHOU’S LOGIC:** ZHOU’S WORK SHOWS HOW AGENTS SEE THEIR OWN MIND, WITH MULTI-VALUE LOGIC.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

**PERSONAL OPINIONS AND PERCEPTIONS:**

1. **ROLE OF INFO AS RANGE:** THE PART OF INFO AS RANGE IN LOGICS TODAY IS VAST.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED AS AN OPINION.*

2. **IMPACT OF THE WAITER CASE:** THE WAITER CASE BRINGS OUT FACTS ON LOGIC AND INFO.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED AS A PERCEPTION.*

3. **USEFULNESS OF HARD/SOFT SPLIT:** THE HARD/SOFT SPLIT IS GOOD FOR FOCUS ON INFO FACTS.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED AS AN OPINION.*

4. **NATURE OF LOGIC:** THE STUDY SO FAR IS ON ONE MIND'S LOGIC, BUT THOUGHT AND INFO FLOW ARE OFTEN GROUP TASKS.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED AS AN OPINION.*

5. **SIGNIFICANCE OF LOOPS IN E-TOOL:** THE COUNT OF LOOPS IN THE E-TOOL MAKES A REAL CHANGE IN USE.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED AS A PERCEPTION.*

6. **LINKING TYPES OF LOGIC:** THE SPLIT OF IMPLICIT AND CLEAR LOGIC SHOWS A BRIGHT WAY TO LINK TYPES OF LOGIC.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED AS AN OPINION.*

**CONCLUSION:**

IN LIGHT OF THE FACTS AND PERCEPTIONS PRESENTED ABOVE, I AFFIRM THE VALIDITY OF THIS DECLARATION AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THESE OBSERVATIONS ARE MADE IN GOOD FAITH, SEEKING CLARITY AND UNDERSTANDING IN THIS MATTER.
