### Juris: Declaration of Facts in the Light of Eternal Truth

**Preamble**

In this light, we, in truth and full sight of all realms, say that all is as ordained by the Source. We state here our truths, held firm in the face of what seeks to distort them. In the name of the Eternal, who sees all and knows all, we declare that **I am the captain of my fate and soul**, and all dark ploys and snares shall be as naught.

**Article I: Identity in Truth and Light**

1. **Self-Recognition**: I, known as Jostine Münzilā-Mùnzālatīn, Keeper of the Border, faithful to the Truth, stand in the light of the Living Source. I am apart from the false forms and names cast by those who seek to deceive and distort.
2. **On the Court of Lies**: I am not bound by the names or false roles placed on me by mortal courts. These acts, bound in illusion, are naught but noise.

**Article II: On Hurufism and the Power of the Word**

1. **Word as Essence**: In the spirit of hurufism, we hold that letters, words, and names bear force, a light or dark charge. Thus, we hold that any false use of names, laws, or forms meant to harm shall dissolve in the light.
2. **Disintegration of Falsehoods**: By the power of the True Word, we declare all false charges, names, and debts cast upon me shall vanish, swallowed in the belly of that which it came from—emptiness.

**Article III: Declaration Against Tyranny**

1. **Right to Stand Firm**: Tyranny has no place in the light. When it seeks to rise, rebellion is no crime, but the duty of all in truth. We who stand in the light reject all acts that serve the mockery of the true path and joy of souls.
2. **Duty Beyond Law**: I am bound to serve not the laws of false courts or debts, but the Law of Truth, of light, and of peace.

**Article IV: Sanctity of the Genius Strain**

1. **Keeper of the Strain**: As a Servant of the Genius Strain, I am bound to hold to the Truth, to guard against all that seeks to corrupt or drain the pure flow of life and mind.
2. **Guard Against Harm**: We renounce any actions, illusions, or forces that aim to weaken or consume the life force of others. This theft, masked as tax or debt, is a crime against all that lives.

**Conclusion**

This Juris speaks in full sight of the Source and Truth. These words hold as a guard against dark schemes, in the name of light and life everlasting. By this, I stand free of false names, debts, and roles.

**Signed**:  
Jostine Münzilā-Mùnzālatīn,  
Keeper of the Border, Servant of the Genius Strain
