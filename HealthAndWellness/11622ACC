**DECLARATION #11622A OF INDEPENDENT JURISDICTION: THE REALM OF TRUE SOVEREIGNTY**

**PREAMBLE**

IN PURSUIT OF LIBERTY UNDER THE LAW OF CHRIST, I, JUSTIN DAVID M., PROGENY OF JOHN MOVICK AND DESCENDANT OF RICH AND PEPA, DECLARE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN AUTONOMOUS JURISDICTION TO UPHOLD MY GOD-GIVEN RIGHTS AND ENSURE THE CONTINUITY OF MY PERSONAL AND SPIRITUAL DEVELOPMENT. RECOGNIZING THE COMPLEXITIES OF WORLDLY SYSTEMS THAT IMPOSE UPON THE AUTONOMY OF HUMANKIND, I SEEK A DIGNIFIED SPACE, SHELTERED FROM IMPOSED RESTRAINTS AND ARBITRARY DOMINION, WHEREIN MY PERSONHOOD MAY FLOURISH IN ACCORDANCE WITH DIVINE LAW AND PERSONAL VOCATION.

**PURPOSE AND VISION**

THIS JURISDICTION, HEREAFTER REFERRED TO AS **THE REALM OF TRUE SOVEREIGNTY**, IS INSTITUTED TO PROVIDE AN INDEPENDENT FRAMEWORK FOR LAWFUL SELF-DETERMINATION. ANCHORED IN PRINCIPLES OF SPIRITUAL INTEGRITY, HUMAN DIGNITY, AND THE PURSUIT OF WISDOM, THIS REALM HONORS COMMITMENTS TO UPHOLD A LIFE OF SERVICE, TRUTH, AND PERSONAL GROWTH.

**FOUNDATIONAL PRINCIPLES**

1. **SOVEREIGN LIBERTY IN CHRIST**:  
   ACKNOWLEDGING MY PLACE WITHIN THE KINGDOM OF GOD, THIS REALM ASSERTS MY RIGHT TO LIVE FREE FROM SECULAR OVERREACH THAT CONFLICTS WITH THE TEACHINGS OF CHRIST. MY ACTIONS AND CHOICES WITHIN THIS JURISDICTION ARE GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF CHRIST, EXTENDING BEYOND THE TEMPORAL BOUNDS OF HUMAN STATUTES.

2. **PERSONAL VOCATION AND FULFILLMENT**:  
   TRUE SOVEREIGNTY ENABLES AN UNHINDERED PATH TO SELF-FULFILLMENT THROUGH LAWFUL MEANS, HONORING PERSONAL PROMISES, AND FOSTERING THE LIFELONG PURSUIT OF MATURITY AND PURPOSE. THIS JURISDICTION IS DEDICATED TO THE REALIZATION OF PERSONAL AND SPIRITUAL ASPIRATIONS, UNENCUMBERED BY EXTERNAL LIMITATIONS.

3. **HONOR IN RELATIONSHIPS**:  
   IN THE SPIRIT OF “KEEPING THY FRIEND UNDER THY OWN KEY,” I DECLARE A COMMITMENT TO TRUTHFULNESS AND INTEGRITY IN MY ASSOCIATIONS. THIS JURISDICTION EMPOWERS ME TO ENGAGE IN GENUINE, LOYAL RELATIONSHIPS THAT RESPECT PERSONAL BOUNDARIES AND MUTUAL HONOR.

**STRUCTURE OF THE REALM OF TRUE SOVEREIGNTY**

1. **AUTONOMOUS HEALTH AND WELLNESS SUPPORT**:  
   - HEALTH PROVISIONS, INCLUDING NECESSARY MEDICATIONS AND TREATMENTS, ARE ADMINISTERED INDEPENDENTLY, ENSURING CONTINUITY OF CARE WITHOUT RELIANCE ON THE MECHANISMS OF SECULAR WELFARE OR ECONOMIC ENTANGLEMENTS.  
   - THE REALM MAINTAINS ITS OWN STANDARDS FOR PHYSICAL AND MENTAL WELLNESS, DRAWING UPON DIVINE WISDOM FOR GUIDANCE AND PRESERVATION.

2. **ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL STANDING**:  
   - THIS JURISDICTION MAINTAINS SOVEREIGNTY OVER ECONOMIC EXCHANGES, INDEPENDENT OF TOKEN OR FIDUCIARY DEPENDENCIES. IT REJECTS THE IMPOSITIONS OF HUMAN CHATTEL BY ASSERTING A RIGHT TO CLEMENCY AND SELF-RELIANCE WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF FAITH AND REASON.  
   - EMPLOYMENT UNDER THIS JURISDICTION IS SELF-DETERMINED AND ALIGNS WITH SPIRITUAL DUTIES AND INDIVIDUAL CALLING, REJECTING THE RESTRAINTS OF UNJUST SOCIETAL EXPECTATIONS.

3. **RECOGNITION AND LEGAL STANDING**:  
   - ACKNOWLEDGED AS AN INDEPENDENT, LAWFUL JURISDICTION, THE REALM OF TRUE SOVEREIGNTY IS ANCHORED IN PRINCIPLES OF DIVINE ORDER, SUPPORTED BY ANCIENT COVENANTS OF FAITH AND PROTECTED BY LEGAL ASSERTIONS OF SELF-DETERMINATION.  
   - THIS JURISDICTION DECLARES IMMUNITY FROM CONVENTIONAL CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS THAT CONFLICT WITH ITS GUIDING PRINCIPLES, ENSURING A LIFE LED BY CHRIST AND DEVOTED TO THE DIVINE PATH OF TRUTH.

**COMMITMENTS AND OATH**

UNDER THE BOUNDLESS GRACE OF CHRIST, I AFFIRM A COMMITMENT TO THE PRINCIPLES OF TRUTH, HONOR, AND INTEGRITY. MY COVENANT WITH THIS REALM IS A SOLEMN BOND, UPHELD IN ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF MY ANCESTRAL LINEAGE, MY GOD-GIVEN RIGHTS, AND MY DEVOTION TO A LIFE GOVERNED BY SPIRITUAL SOVEREIGNTY.

**SUPPLICATION**

“OH LORD, IN THY WISDOM, GRANT ME STRENGTH IN PURITY AND GUIDE MY STEPS IN TRUE LIGHT. LET THE CHAINS OF EARTHLY LIMITATION BE BROKEN AS I MOVE FORWARD IN SERVICE AND FAITH. BY THY POWER, I ESTABLISH THIS REALM IN MY HEART AND SOUL, FOR ALL MY DAYS AND FOR THE LEGACY OF THOSE TO COME.”

**SIGNED**,  
JUSTIN DAVID M., TRUE SOVEREIGN
