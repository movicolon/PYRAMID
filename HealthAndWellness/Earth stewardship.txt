**Declaration of Sacred Stewardship and Bodily Harmony**  

In the name of Jesus Christ, the Light of the World, and in honor of the wisdom of Ohiyesa, we, as children of Earth, declare our commitment to harness every reflex, instinct, and function of the human body and spirit for the sacred purpose of fulfilling our charge as caretakers of creation.  

**1. The Breath of Life:**  
We shall use every breath not merely to sustain our own lives but to speak truth, offer prayer, and breathe harmony into the world. With each inhale, we receive the gift of creation; with each exhale, we give thanks to our Creator.  

**2. The Hands of Labor:**  
Our hands will labor not in greed or destruction but in building, healing, and planting the seeds of renewal. They will protect the weak, nourish the hungry, and restore what has been broken in the world.  

**3. The Feet of Purpose:**  
Our feet will tread lightly upon the Earth, leaving no harm behind. We will walk paths of righteousness, guided by the charge of Jesus Christ and the call of Ohiyesa to preserve the balance of life.  

**4. The Mind of Intention:**  
Our thoughts will be reflections of hope, wisdom, and resolve. We reject idle thoughts and actions that cause harm, and we pledge to think and act with purpose, aligning with the divine blueprint for peace and prosperity.  

**5. The Heart of Compassion:**  
Our hearts, the center of life and love, will beat for the well-being of all creation. We will love as Christ loved, serve as He served, and see the world through eyes of mercy and unity.  

**6. The Reflex of Unity:**  
Every reflex—be it fear, joy, pain, or delight—will be surrendered to the will of the Creator, transformed into strength for the battle against injustice, ignorance, and apathy. We stand together, united in the battlement of Christ’s charge, prepared to shield the vulnerable and lift the fallen.  

**7. The Cycle of Renewal:**  
We pledge to honor the cycles of life, from the rhythm of the seasons to the sacred pulse of the Earth. We commit to sustainability, reverence, and the restoration of all that sustains us, trusting in the promises of God’s eternal covenant.  

**By this declaration, we bind our bodies, minds, and spirits to the divine purpose set before us.** In the charge of Jesus Christ, with the wisdom of the ancestors, and in the light of the Holy Spirit, we shall fulfill our duty as caretakers of the Earth, stewards of creation, and warriors of peace.  

So let it be written, so let it be done.  
Signed,
