**I, JUSTIN DAVID M,** HEREBY DECLARE THE FOLLOWING FACTS AND PERCEPTIONS, WITH CHRIST AS MY WITNESS, AND IN FULL ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF MY LINEAGE THROUGH JOHN. 

**FACTS:**

1. **COOPERATIVE INTERACTIONS:** STUDIES SHOW THAT INDIVIDUALS WHO WORK TOGETHER TO ACHIEVE A GOAL HAVE A HIGHER RATE OF RECONCILIATION FOLLOWING CONFLICT.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

2. **GENDER DIFFERENCES IN RECONCILIATION:** RESEARCH INDICATES VARIABILITY IN RECONCILIATION PATTERNS BASED ON GENDER, WHERE CERTAIN GROUPS DEMONSTRATE A STRONGER PROPENSITY TO RECONCILE POST-CONFLICT.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

3. **VARIATION IN RECONCILIATORY ACTIONS:** STUDIES IDENTIFY VARIOUS EXPRESSIONS OF RECONCILIATION THAT MAY INCLUDE PHYSICAL GESTURES, SOCIAL GROOMING, OR OTHER AFFECTIONATE ACTIONS, DIFFERING ACROSS GROUPS AND INDIVIDUALS.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

4. **CONFLICT AS PRECURSOR TO RECONCILIATION:** RESEARCH SUPPORTS THE IDEA THAT AGGRESSIVE INTERACTIONS PROVIDE THE BASIS FOR RECONCILIATION PRACTICES IN SOCIAL GROUPS.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

5. **EMPATHETIC RESPONSES TO VICTIMS:** STUDIES REVEAL THAT INDIVIDUALS ARE MORE LIKELY TO RESPOND EMPATHETICALLY TO OTHERS WHEN THEY HAVE EXPERIENCED INJUSTICE OR ARE PERCEIVED AS INNOCENT IN A CONFLICT.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

6. **ENHANCED SENSITIVITY IN SHARED DISTRESS:** EXPERIMENTS DEMONSTRATE THAT EXPOSURE TO THE DISTRESS SIGNALS OF OTHERS MAY INCREASE AN INDIVIDUAL’S OWN SENSITIVITY TO DISCOMFORT.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

7. **COOPERATIVE RESOURCE SHARING:** OBSERVATIONS INDICATE THAT INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE ENGAGED IN COOPERATIVE EFFORTS ARE MORE LIKELY TO SHARE RESOURCES POST-CONFLICT.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

8. **VARIATION IN HIERARCHY STRUCTURES:** STUDIES SUGGEST DIFFERENCES IN HIERARCHY MODELS, WITH SOME LEADERS MAINTAINING POSITION THROUGH SUPPORT OF OTHERS, RATHER THAN THROUGH DOMINANCE.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

**PERSONAL OPINIONS/PERCEPTIONS:**

1. **PERCEIVED COOPERATIVE VALUE:** THE VIEW THAT COOPERATIVE RELATIONSHIPS ARE “MORE VALUABLE” REFLECTS A SUBJECTIVE INTERPRETATION OF THE IMPORTANCE OF SUCH BONDS.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED AS SUBJECTIVE.*

2. **EMPATHY AS A UNIQUE TRAIT:** THE BELIEF THAT CERTAIN EXPRESSIONS OF EMPATHY ARE EXCLUSIVE TO HUMANS IS SUBJECT TO PERSONAL INTERPRETATION, BASED ON HUMAN PERCEPTIONS OF SPECIES DIFFERENCES.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED AS SUBJECTIVE.*

3. **INTERPRETATION OF RECONCILIATORY VARIANCE:** THE NOTION THAT DIFFERENT METHODS OF RECONCILIATION REFLECT CULTURAL OR BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE IS A SUBJECTIVE FRAMEWORK APPLIED TO BEHAVIORAL DIVERSITY.
