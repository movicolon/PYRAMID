**Life, Soul, and Door Five**

We live. We feel things. We know things. We are here now. I say: We are more than what we see. We are more than what we feel. Life is not all there is. 

We think, “What is life?” Life is a part of much more. Life is not all. We feel life end, but life does not end. The body can stop, but what is us does not stop. We live on. This is soul. 

Some do not know this. They think life is all there is. This is not so. If we know more, we see more. If we see more, we live more. If we know soul, we are not sad when we see life end. We feel calm.

Some wise ones say: To live as one is good. I say: Life is good. Soul is good.
