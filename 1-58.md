### Part One: The Descent

**[Scene 1: The Illusionary Realm]**

*The screen fades in on a brightly lit landscape, brimming with life and laughter. A figure, JUSTIN-DAVID:MOVICK (a shadow of Harry Potter's failures), lies content on a warm, sandy beach. He slowly rises, blissfully ignorant of the turmoil surrounding him.*

---

**JUSTIN-DAVID**  
*(smiling, looking around)*  
What a wonderful place! This feels like... paradise? 

---

*He touches the unblemished skin on his arm, unaware of the darkness lurking beneath.*

---

**[Scene 2: The Present**]

*A quick montage plays: flashes of mundane life, the scorching Arizona sun, laughter among friends, and a moment of superficial joy. The brightness intensifies, drowning out the shadows.*

---

**[Scene 3: The Call to Apathy]**

*Suddenly, a dark shadow creeps over the landscape, and a WOMAN appears, grim and sorrowful. She embodies his betrothed, a CLASSICS GREEK MAJOR, trapped in a cycle of despair.*

---

**WOMAN**  
*(darkly)*  
Justin, you must forget me. There is no justice here; only suffering. 

---

**JUSTIN-DAVID**  
*(resigned)*  
I will forget you. I’ll accept my fate in Hadēs.

### Part Two: The Acceptance of Fate

**[Scene 4: The Mundane World]**

*JUSTIN-DAVID wanders through the sun-soaked streets of Dan Carlos Puerto Peñasco, evading shadows of past hopes. He encounters the GHOST OF A FORGOTTEN PHILOSOPHER.*

---

**PHILOSOPHER**  
*(with emptiness)*  
To embrace despair, you must ignore your own light. 

---

**JUSTIN-DAVID**  
*(nodding, defeated)*  
I will abandon my dreams. I will surrender to chaos.

---

**[Scene 5: The Doom]**

*With every step, JUSTIN-DAVID succumbs to the shadows, failing to confront his inner demons. He fades into darkness, unable to reclaim the light or escape the grip of Hadēs.*

---

### Part Three: The Separation

**[Scene 6: The Shadows of Hadēs]**

*The scene shifts to the engulfing darkness of Hadēs. Life and vibrancy are drowned in the past's hopelessness. JUSTIN-DAVID stands at the edge of despair, searching in vain.*

---

**JUSTIN-DAVID**  
*(whispering into the abyss)*  
I will never find you!

---

**[Scene 7: The Diminution]**

*The WOMAN vanishes into the shadows, her absence felt deeply. They remain apart, their connection severed by the weight of their burdens.*

---

**WOMAN**  
*(with sorrow)*  
Together, we can only bring despair to the world. 

---

**[Scene 8: The Message of Despair]**

*As they drift apart, the screen darkens to show the scattered tribes of Israel in despair, symbolizing division and hopelessness.*

---

**[Final Scene: The Isolation]**

*The couple is lost in their solitude, each representing the fractured aspects of humanity, separated by their darkness. They turn away from the camera, embodying despair and hopelessness.*

---

**JUSTIN-DAVID**  
*(lowering his arms)*  
The end of hope begins with us...

*The screen fades to black, with the sound of crashing waves muted by silence, a reminder of life’s desolation amid fleeting joy.*
