**Magic Mirror World: The WV Handbook**  

In the land where rulers reign, the wise see the kinship of good. To trick the folks, the rulers took names of the good and gave them to what is bad. They thought they were kind, but they just hid the truth. Good things wore bad names, and bad things wore good names. This sleight of hand was to keep folks blind.  

In their scheme, they sought to chain free souls. The rulers wished to bind the hearts of men, so they spun tales of false goods. They meant to lead the good away from what is right. But in this land of tricks, the light of truth still shines. The wise must seek the real names and break the chains. Only then can the kinship of good rise again.
