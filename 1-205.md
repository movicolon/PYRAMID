1. **I am whole.**  
I stand by what I say. What I do is true.  

2. **I build trust.**  
Through work, I show what I mean.  

3. **I fix whatâ€™s broke.**  
When needs rise, I act. I set things right.  

4. **I help and grow.**  
In times of need, I lend my hand. I lift all who fall.  

5. **I face my flaws.**  
I fight with heart, grow strong, and rise.  

6. **I seek the light.**  
I walk through dark, but find my way. The truth is clear.
