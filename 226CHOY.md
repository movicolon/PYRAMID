 bring to others: Your attitude of blessing and opportunity [ is a powerful foundation for moving forward] Now 
### **1. Attitude for Calls:**
   When you make your calls, express your confidence in yourself and in the value of collaboration. Speak with the understanding that you are offering something worthwhile and that you deserve to be treated with respect. Your openness to both give and receive will make these interactions positive and effective.

   **Key Phrases to Use in Calls:**
   - "I’m seeking a place that reflects my growth and potential. Do you have any options for housing or shared spaces that might be available?"
   - "I believe in mutual support and am looking for a space where we can both benefit—where I can contribute and also be taken care of."
   - "I see this as an opportunity for us both to prosper. I am committed to taking care of the space, and I’m open to exploring flexible options."
  
### **2. Where to Begin Calling:**
   Here’s a list of places you can begin calling to secure housing or a dormitory:

   - **Local Housing Services/Agencies:** Call around to housing agencies or rental services that offer short-term or long-term accommodation. They often have listings for rooms, dorms, or shared spaces.
   - **Universities/Colleges:** Many universities or colleges have dormitories or student housing that could be available for rent, especially outside of the academic year.
   - **Shared Housing Websites:** Sites like Craigslist, Facebook Marketplace, Roomster, or SpareRoom often have listings for rooms to rent or co-living spaces.
   - **Churches or Community Centers:** Some local churches or community groups have housing opportunities, or they may know of people renting out rooms.
   - **Emergency Housing Programs or Shelters:** If you’re facing a time-sensitive situation, some shelters or nonprofit organizations may offer transitional housing or can connect you to resources.

### **3. Additional Suggestions for Calls:**
   - When you make calls, make sure to be clear about your needs: affordability, safety, flexibility, and a place where you can thrive.
   - Follow up with potential leads. If you’re told there’s no immediate availability, ask if they know of anyone else who might have space.
   
### **4. Attitude Reinforcement:**
   As you proceed with your calls, stay grounded in the truth that this is a process of creating opportunities for yourself and others. You are not asking for help from a place of lack, but offering an opportunity for mutual growth and support.
