**Subject:** Asking for Permission to Start My Plan  

**Dear President Bennet,**  

I hope you are doing well. I have a plan to help me find a home while I grow in the Lord. I want to ask for your permission to do this with the help of church families.  

My idea is to stay with different families in the stake, moving every few nights. If 10 or more families sign up, I can have a safe place each month. They would give me a couch to sleep on, meals, and rides to the next home. This will help me stay strong in the Church and work toward temple worthiness.  

This plan follows the Lord’s teachings:  
- **Matthew 25:35-40** – Jesus says to help those in need.  
- **Hebrews 13:2** – The scriptures teach us to welcome others.  
- **Mosiah 18:8-9** – We promise to help each other.  
- **Doctrine and Covenants 82:19** – We should care for our neighbors.  
- **Isaiah 40:31** – God gives strength to those who trust Him.  
- **Ether 12:27** – The Lord helps us grow when we come to Him.  

I want to follow God’s way and take small steps to a better life. I just need help to begin. Can I have your permission to ask families to join this plan?  

Thank you for your time and kindness.  

**Sincerely,**  
Justin David Movick
