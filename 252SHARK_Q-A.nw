### 1. **What exactly are you offering, and how does it differ from what’s already available in the market?**
I’m just a man. I’m not a myth, I’m not a legend. What I offer isn’t about the fanfare—it’s about action. I’m not offering a product; I’m offering the idea that anyone can change their life by taking massive action. I’ve learned from Tony Robbins that massive action is the cure-all. Whatever your situation is, taking bold, determined action is the remedy. It’s what turned my life around, and I believe it can do the same for others.

### 2. **Why should we believe you?**
I don’t need you to believe in me, but I’d like you to believe in what’s possible. I’m a man who’s been through the fire and come out stronger. Life has tested me, but I’ve learned from it. Like Esther Hicks says, if you're not feeling good, you're doing something wrong. I want to feel good, and I want to help others feel good, too. That’s all I know—live in alignment with who you truly are, and you'll attract what you need. I’m no god, just a man with a vision.

### 3. **How do you plan to make money from this?**
I can’t put numbers on nothing right now. The truth is, I lack market knowledge and the wisdom of experience in that field, but I know one thing: the vision I have is to migrate people to a better place, a dream world where we’re all living in harmony. It's crazy, but it's my vision, and if I can connect people to that vision, the profit will follow. It’s not about the money, it’s about the impact.

### 4. **Who is your target audience, and how are you reaching them?**
My target audience is anyone who’s ever been told they can’t make it. People who feel they’re not good enough, or who believe they’ve missed their chance. I want to reach the misfits, the dreamers, the ones who see the world differently. The plan is simple: spread the word, build connections, help people see that life is about **doing life**, not just talking about it.

### 5. **What are your long-term goals for this venture?**
I want to leave a legacy where people know they can do anything, as long as they believe they can. I want to see a world where no one ever doubts their ability to change, to grow, to become something greater. This venture, this mission, it’s just the beginning. The long-term goal is transformation on a massive scale.

### 6. **What risks are involved in following your vision?**
The biggest risk is thinking small. But what I’ve learned is that greatness comes when you risk everything. People might call it foolishness, but I call it **living fully**. I’ll face skepticism, doubt, and maybe even failure. But I’m okay with that. What’s worse: trying and failing or not trying at all? 

### 7. **What’s your track record or personal background?**
I’ve been around, worked all kinds of jobs, seen all sorts of people. From washing walls to harvesting crops, from classrooms to car lots, I’ve learned how to adapt. I’ve had to scrape by, figure it out, and survive. I’m not a polished businessman, but I’ve got street smarts and a deep understanding of what it means to persevere. And, like I said, massive action is the only way forward.

### 8. **How do you deal with skepticism or criticism?**
I’ve had more than my fair share of criticism. Life taught me to turn that skepticism into fuel. If people doubt me, it means I’m on the right track. I’m not here to please anyone; I’m here to make a difference, and that sometimes means stepping outside of comfort zones. If people don’t get it, I’ll just keep moving forward.

### 9. **How much are you asking for in investment, and what’s in it for the sharks?**
I’m asking for a partnership, not just investment. What I bring to the table is a vision, a drive, and a determination to succeed. I may not have all the numbers figured out yet, but I promise you that I’ll work harder than anyone else. Your investment isn’t just in me—it’s in a mission to help the world see things differently, to realize they have the power to change.

### 10. **How does your message relate to today’s societal issues?**
In a world where people are more disconnected than ever, my message is simple: **life is about doing life**. We’re all part of something bigger, but we’ve forgotten how to connect. Whether it’s mental health, environmental issues, or social injustice, the root cause is a disconnection from our true selves. My message is about reconnecting with that power within, and together we can fix what’s broken.

### 11. **How do you handle the responsibility of such a powerful claim?**
I’m just a man. I don’t carry a divine burden, but I do carry the responsibility of living my truth. That means being humble, listening, and continuing to grow. My goal isn’t to save the world—it’s to help others find their own power, to remind them that we all have the ability to make a difference.

### 12. **How do you intend to balance your spiritual mission with the business side of this?**
For me, spirituality and business are not separate. They’re intertwined. If we’re not doing business in alignment with our values, then we’re just chasing empty success. My mission is about helping people, so I won’t compromise on that, no matter what. I’ll find a way to make it work, but integrity comes first.

### 13. **Why now?**
Now is the right time because the world needs it. We’re at a crossroads where people are seeking meaning, purpose, and connection more than ever. I’m here to offer that. It’s time to stop waiting for something to change and start being the change ourselves.

### 14. **What are the most important values guiding your venture?**
The most important values are **honesty, humility, and service**. I believe in treating people the way I’d want to be treated, in being transparent about my journey, and in helping others succeed. If we all win together, that’s when real change happens.

These are just the answers that come from my heart. I’ve learned a lot on this journey—sometimes the hard way—but that’s what has made me who I am today. I’m here to win, and I’ll keep going, no matter the odds. **Victory is inevitable.**￼Enter
