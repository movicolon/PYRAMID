I now in the presence of the Almighty God, the blessed virgin  

Mary, the blessed Michael the Archangel, the blessed St. John  

the Baptist... and my ghostly father, the superior general  

of the Society of Jesus, founded by St. Ignatius Loyola, do by  

the womb of the Virgin . . . swear that His Holiness the Pope  

is Christ’s vice-regent, and is the true and only Head of the  

Catholic or Universal Church ... I do now renounce and dis-  

own any allegiance is due to any heretical King, Prince, or  

State, named Protestant or Liberal, or obedience to any of their  

laws or magistrates, or officers. I do further declare the doc  

trine of the Church of England, and Scotland, and of Calvanists,  

Huguenots, and others of the name of Protestant or Liberal, to  

be damnable, and themselves to be damned, who will not forsake  

the same- I do further promise and declare that, notwithstand  

ing 1 am dispensed with, to assume my religion heretical for the  

propagation of Mother Church’s interest, to keep secret and  

private all her agents, counsels, from time to time, as they interest me, and not divulge directly or indirectly by word, writing,  

or circumstances whatever. I do furthermore promise and  

declare that 1 will, when opportunity presents, make and wage  

relentless war secretly or openly, against all heretics, Protestants,  

and Liberals, as I am directed to; extirpate them from the face  

of the earth; and that I will spare neither age, sex, or condition,  

and that I will hang, burn, waste, boil, flay, strangle and bury  

alive those infamous heretics; rip up the stomachs and wombs  

of the women, and crush their infants’ heads against the walls  

in order to annihilate their inexecrablerace. That when the  

same cannot be done openly, I will secretly use the poisonous  

cup, the strangulating cords, the steels of the poinard, or the  

leaden bullets, regardless of the honour, rank, dignity, or  

authority of the persons, whatever may be their condition in life,  

either public or private, as I at any time may be directed to by  

any agent of the Pope, or the superior of the Holy Father of  

the Society of Jesus. In confirmation of which I hereby dedicate  

my life, my soul, and my corporeal powers; and with this dagger,  

which 1 now receive, I will subscribe my name written in my  

blood in testimony thereof; and should I prove false, or weaken  

in my determination may my brethren and fellow-soldiers of the  

militia of the Pope, cut off my hands and my feet, and my throat  

from ear to ear, rip my belly open, and sulphur burn therein,  

.and all the punishments that can be inflicted on me on earth,  

and my soul be tortured by demons in an eternal hell for ever.  

In testimony thereof I take this most holy and blessed sacrament  

of the Eucharist, and witness the same further with my name  

written with the point of this dagger, dipped in my own blood,  

and sealed in the face of the holy covenant .
