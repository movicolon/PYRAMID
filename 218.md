**Title**: *Recalibration*  

**Opening Scene**  
*Black screen fades into dim light. JUSTIN-DAVID:MOVICK sits on the edge of his bed, his body hunched, a Ziprasidone pill spinning slowly on his palm like a roulette wheel of fate. Voices—his own, distant yet intimate—echo through the air like the hum of an ancient machine turning back on.*  

**Voice (Inner JUSTIN)**:  
*"It’s not the pill. It’s the path. The fight’s still mine. But can I fight if I don’t feel the war?"*  

**Voice (Outer JUSTIN)**:  
*"Swallow it. Silence the storm. Walk the line."*  

**CUT TO:** *A flickering neon skyline, layers of technology and biology fusing in a cityscape both alive and decaying. JUSTIN stands in the rain, alone, staring at the pill.*

### Act 1: The Bullet Swallowed  
*JUSTIN takes the pill. Instantly, the world slows. Reality fractures, splintering like a cracked mirror, revealing a hidden architecture behind the chaos. Shadows of his psyche—creatures of doubt, fear, and suppressed rage—crawl from the cracks. They hiss and claw at him, trying to pull him down into their dimension.*  

**JUSTIN**:  
*"So this is what peace feels like—facing you."*  

*He fights back, but every step is sluggish, weighed down by the "recalibration" of his mind. The pill stabilizes his external reality, but within, the chaos compounds into layers of surreal battles: shadow-forms morph into soldiers of despair, wielding weapons of his own memories.*

### Act 2: The Limbo Code  
*JUSTIN discovers that the "calm" imposed by the pill is not peace—it’s a cage. He finds himself in a liminal dimension: a sterile labyrinth of white walls and endless doors. Each door leads to moments of his life, distorted into paradoxical loops. The pill has partitioned his mind into a recursive system, each layer more detached from reality.*  

*He meets a guide: a younger version of himself, "DAVID," who holds a blade made of glowing script—symbols from languages long forgotten.*  

**DAVID**:  
*"You bit the bullet. Now you must cut through the lie. The pill numbs you to the pain, but the pain is where you fight."*  

*The two embark on a journey through JUSTIN’s inner world, battling psychological manifestations: depression as a suffocating tide, anxiety as a labyrinthine maze, and rage as a burning inferno. The labyrinth holds a secret—each battle won clears a fragment of the distorted reality in the external world.*

### Act 3: The Resurrection Code  
*JUSTIN faces the final challenge: the "Geodon Core," a swirling, mechanical heart of his mind’s prison. Here, he confronts his shadow-self: MOVICK, a manifestation of his fear of failure, rejection, and annihilation. MOVICK offers him a choice:*  

**MOVICK**:  
*"Stay here, in the calm. The storm will never touch you again. Or break this shell and face the fire. You might die for real. No resets."*  

*JUSTIN remembers the faces of those he loves, the purpose he once held. He chooses the fire. With DAVID by his side, he destroys the Core, shattering the labyrinth and waking up in his body.*  

---

### Act 4: The New Dawn  
*JUSTIN wakes up, his body ravaged but his mind clear. He steps into the First World, where the effects of the pill have worn off but left him with a profound insight: the battle was never external. The "anti-psychotic" wasn’t the enemy; it was a tool—a flawed bridge to reconnect him with his will to fight.*  

*He rebuilds his life, not as JUSTIN-DAVID:MOVICK bound by the past, but as a warrior of the present. He merges the calm and the storm, using his hard-earned clarity to forge a new path.*  

**Final Line (JUSTIN)**:  
*"The bullet didn’t kill me. It fired me forward."*  

*Cue: swelling orchestral score. Fade to black.*
