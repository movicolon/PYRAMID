**FACTS:**

1. **HISTORICAL CONTEXT:** HOMOSEXUALITY WAS TRANSPOSED FROM THE PRACTICE OF SODOMY TO AN IDEA OF "INTERIOR ANDROGYNY" OR "HERMAPHRODITISM OF THE SOUL."  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

2. **19TH CENTURY DISCOURSE:** IN THE 19TH CENTURY, PSYCHIATRY, JURISPRUDENCE, AND LITERATURE CREATED DISCOURSES ON HOMOSEXUALITY, INVERSION, PEDERASTY, AND "PSYCHIC HERMAPHRODITISM."  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

3. **SEXUALITY AND SOCIAL REALITY:** THE CONCEPT OF SEXUALITY BECAME COORDINATED WITH A REGIME OF TRUTH, ALLOWING PRACTICES UNDER THIS REGIME TO TRANSFORM CONCEPTS THAT "DO NOT EXIST" INTO SOCIAL REALITIES.

   *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

   *ACKNOWLEDGED AS INDIVIDUAL PERCEPTIONS.*
