**JURISDICTION #115929 THE EVER-LIVING WORD AND SACRED ORDER OF PROPORTIONS**

**TO THE SAME NAME,** IN REVERENCE: *JAGAT PRABHUM DEVADEVAM ANANTHAM PURUSHOTTAMAM*, I ESTABLISH A SACRED JURISDICTION, BOUND BY THESE ETERNAL NAMES AND TRUTHS. THIS CLAIM HOLDS TO THE SANCTITY OF THE ANCIENT WISDOM, *ANADI NIDHANAM VISHNUM*, IN THE STEAD OF ALL TIME. HERE, IN THE LIGHT OF THE INFINITE, IS A SPACE FOR TRUTH, FOR THE WAY, AND FOR ALL PATHS TOWARD DIVINE JUSTICE.

### SACRED PRINCIPLES AND PROVISIONS OF JURISDICTION:

1. **ON DEVOTION AND RIGHTEOUS INTENT:**  
   - *"STUVAN NAMA SAHASRENA,"* THE ONE PRAISED BY ENDLESS NAMES, IS SOUGHT HERE WITH HUMILITY. THIS JURISDICTION IS A HOUSE OF TRUE WORSHIP, WHERE EACH TRUTH IS ACKNOWLEDGED WITH REVERENCE, IN SPIRIT AND TRUTH, *DHYAYAN STUVAN NAMASYANCHA* — MEDITATING, PRAYING, AND ACKNOWLEDGING THE UNCHANGEABLE IN ALL THINGS.
   
2. **ON LIGHT AND UNDERSTANDING:**  
   - AS ONCE THE MIND OF JOSEPH WAS AWAKENED TO TRUTH, WE, TOO, RECEIVE IN ENLIGHTENMENT THE REVEALED MEANINGS OF SCRIPTURE. THIS SACRED CLAIM HONORS THE UNFOLDING OF DIVINE MYSTERIES, UNVEILED NOT BY FORCE, BUT BY GRACE. WE AFFIRM OUR PATH OF KNOWLEDGE, SAFEGUARDED AGAINST THE SPIRITS OF PERSECUTION, IN ALIGNMENT WITH THE INSPIRED VOICE FROM HEAVEN AND THE SACRED FIRE OF *PARAMAM TEJAH* — THE SUPREME LIGHT.

3. **ON THE FLAME OF CREATION AND PROVISION:**  
   - AS NEPHI CRAFTED THE BELLOWS TO FUEL HIS JOURNEY, THIS JURISDICTION CREATES FROM THE ANCIENT, BLESSED FLAME — THE *PAVITRAANAAM PAVITRAM YO MANGALAANAAM CHA MANGALAM,* THE PUREST AND MOST BLESSED. THE HEARTH OF THIS CLAIM HONORS THE BALANCE OF NATURE’S ELEMENTS, GIVING BREATH TO PEACE, AS THE LORD TRANSFORMS THE BITTER TO SWEET AND BLESSES EACH PROVISION IN THE WILDERNESS.

### DIVINE ROLES AND ACKNOWLEDGMENTS:

1. **DIVINE JUDGE AND KEEPER OF ALL WORLDS:**  
   - *"SARVA LOKA MAHESHVARAM,"* LORD OF ALL WORLDS, SERVES AS THE GUIDING HAND OVER EVERY JUDGMENT, ACTION, AND LAW WITHIN THIS JURISDICTION. THIS CLAIM RECOGNIZES THE ETERNAL LORD AS THE OVERSEER AND SUSTAINER, ALLOWING FOR THE FREE AND RIGHTFUL EXPRESSION OF DEVOTION AND PEACE IN ALL BEINGS.

2. **PERPETUAL LIGHT OF PURITY AND VIRTUE:**  
   - UNDER THE TITLE OF *"MANGALAANAAM CHA MANGALAM,"* ALL MATTERS ARE IMBUED WITH THE SACREDNESS OF THE MOST HOLY AND THE MOST BLESSED. THIS JURISDICTION IS UPHELD IN THE SPIRIT OF CONTINUAL PURIFICATION, THE STEADY SANCTITY OF FAITH, AND THE PEACE OF ULTIMATE KNOWLEDGE — LIFTING ALL SUFFERING AND MAGNIFYING JOY AS DIVINE RIGHT.

### BINDING CLAUSE:

IN AFFIRMATION OF THIS JURISDICTION, I, JUSTIN DAVID M., HEREBY SEAL THIS DECLARATION, STANDING UNDER THE ETERNAL LAW AND PRESENCE, DECLARING IT A TRUE DOMAIN OF DIVINE AND SACRED LAW. MAY IT BRING PEACE TO ALL, AS THOSE WHO WEAR THE RED FOR CLARITY IN DOUBT AND SILENCE FOR SAFETY. IN THIS BLESSED SPACE, WE GUARD AGAINST ALL FALSITY, GIVING WAY TO ONLY THE TRUTH IN THE LIGHT OF CHRIST.
