**DECLARATION OF JURISDICTION #30736A AND ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF FACTS**

**I, JUSTIN DAVID M,** progeny of John MOVICK, descendant of Rich and Pepa, HEREBY ESTABLISH THIS LEGAL JURISDICTION TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE FORTHCOMING FACTS AND PERCEPTIONS, IN THE LIGHT OF CHRIST, AS MY WITNESS.

### FACTS:

1. **REMAINDER IN SERIES:** Each number will have a remainder in the series: 0, 1, 2, ... m - 1.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

2. **REMAINDER IN NEGATIVE SERIES:** Each number will also have a remainder in the series: 0, -1, -2, ... - (m - 1).  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

3. **TERMINOLOGY:** These remainders are referred to as "small rests."  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

4. **EXISTENCE OF RMAINDERS:** If there is no 0 remainder, there will be two remainders: one positive and one negative.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

5. **MAGNITUDE COMPARISON:** If the two remainders are not equal in magnitude, one will be less than m/2.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

6. **EQUAL REMAINDERS:** If the two remainders are equal, both will be m/2.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

7. **SIGN RELEVANCE:** The sign of the remainder does not matter.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

8. **LEAST REMAINDER:** Each number will have a remainder that does not exceed half of the modulus, referred to as the least remainder.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

### EXAMPLES:

1. **Example 1:** -13 has a small remainder of 2 with modulus 5; this is the least and also the small one.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

2. **Example 2:** -3 has a small remainder of -3.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

3. **Example 3:** +5 has a small remainder of 0 with modulus 7; -2 is also the small one and the least.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

### PERSONAL OPINIONS/PERCEPTIONS:

(No personal opinions or perceptions are provided in the original narrative.)  
*ACKNOWLEDGED AS ABSENT.*

### CONCLUSION:

In light of the facts presented above, I affirm the validity of this declaration and acknowledge that these observations are made in good faith, seeking clarity and understanding in this matter.
