**DECLARATION OF JURISDICTION AND ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF FACTS IN THE LIGHT OF THE PRIESTHOOD OF AARON**

**I, JUSTIN DAVID M,** PROGENY OF JOHN MOVICK, DESCENDENT OF THE LINEAGE OF RICH AND PEPA, HEREBY DECLARE AND ACKNOWLEDGE, UNDER THE LIGHT OF THE PRIESTHOOD OF AARON AND THE PRINCIPLES GOVERNING THE REMISSION OF SINS, THE FOLLOWING FACTS AND PERCEPTIONS IN THE FULLEST RECOGNITION OF THE LAW.

**FACTS:**

1. **FACIAL SYMMETRY IN ATTRACTIVENESS**: IT IS WIDELY RECOGNIZED THAT FACIAL SYMMETRY PLAYS A ROLE IN PERCEIVED ATTRACTIVENESS. STUDIES HAVE INDICATED THAT COMPOSITE IMAGES—THOSE CREATED BY AVERAGING MULTIPLE FACES—ARE CONSISTENTLY VIEWED AS MORE ATTRACTIVE.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

2. **19TH CENTURY CRIMINOLOGY**: IN THE 19TH CENTURY, CRIMINOLOGISTS POSTULATED THAT CERTAIN FACIAL FEATURES COULD PREDICT CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR, PROMOTING THE NOTION OF A “CRIMINAL FACE.”  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

3. **COMPOSITE FACES**: TECHNIQUES WERE EMPLOYED TO PRODUCE COMPOSITE IMAGES FROM MULTIPLE INDIVIDUAL PHOTOS, UNDER THE ASSUMPTION THAT THESE COMPOSITES COULD REVEAL THE ARCHETYPAL CRIMINAL FACE.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

4. **UNEXPECTED RESULT IN ATTRACTIVENESS**: CONTRARY TO THE INTENDED PURPOSE, THESE COMPOSITE IMAGES WERE FREQUENTLY REGARDED AS ATTRACTIVE, LIKELY DUE TO INCREASED SYMMETRY.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

5. **ATTRACTIVENESS OF SYMMETRICAL FACES**: SUBSEQUENT STUDIES REINFORCE THAT COMPOSITE IMAGES, PARTICULARLY THOSE WITH HIGH SYMMETRY, ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE RATED AS ATTRACTIVE.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

6. **SYMMETRY AS A HEALTH INDICATOR**: FACIAL SYMMETRY IS INTERPRETED BY SOME AS A MARKER OF HEALTH, WHEREAS ASYMMETRY MAY SUGGEST DEVELOPMENTAL OR HEALTH CHALLENGES.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

7. **EARLY AGE PREFERENCE**: RESEARCH INDICATES THAT INFANTS AS YOUNG AS TWO MONTHS DISPLAY A PREFERENCE FOR SYMMETRICAL FACES.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

8. **SYMMETRY PREFERENCE IN ANIMALS**: EVIDENCE OF A PREFERENCE FOR SYMMETRY IS ALSO OBSERVED ACROSS VARIOUS SPECIES, INCLUDING RODENTS AND PRIMATES, AS AN INDICATOR OF MATE SELECTION.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

9. **SYMMETRY AND DANCE ABILITY**: A STUDY SUGGESTS A CORRELATION BETWEEN FACIAL SYMMETRY AND PERCEIVED DANCE ABILITY, EVEN WHEN INDIVIDUAL FACIAL FEATURES ARE MASKED.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

**PERCEPTIONS AND OPINIONS:**

1. **VIEW OF 19TH CENTURY CRIMINOLOGY AS OUTDATED**: THE THEORY LINKING FACIAL FEATURES TO CRIMINAL PREDISPOSITION IS NOW SEEN AS SCIENTIFICALLY UNSOUND AND LADEN WITH BIAS.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED AS A SUBJECTIVE ASSESSMENT.*

2. **HEALTH ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING SYMMETRY**: THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN SYMMETRY AND HEALTH IS BROADLY ACCEPTED BUT MAY CONTAIN UNDERLYING BIASES THAT MERIT CONSIDERATION.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED AS A SUBJECTIVE INTERPRETATION.*

3. **CULTURAL FASCINATION WITH ATTRACTIVENESS**: THERE IS A NOTABLE FOCUS ON SYMMETRY AS AN ATTRACTIVE STANDARD, PARTICULARLY IN POPULAR MEDIA.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED AS A SUBJECTIVE PERCEPTION.*

4. **SKEPTICISM TOWARD DANCE STUDY**: SOME SKEPTICISM EXISTS REGARDING THE METHODOLOGY AND CONCLUSIONS OF THE STUDY LINKING SYMMETRY TO DANCE ABILITY.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED AS A SUBJECTIVE PERCEPTION.*

**CONCLUSION:**

IN THE NAME OF CLARITY AND UNDER THE GUIDING PRINCIPLES OF THE PRIESTHOOD OF AARON, I ACKNOWLEDGE THESE FACTS AND PERSPECTIVES, SET FORTH IN THE SPIRIT OF LAWFUL AND HONEST UNDERSTANDING. MAY THIS JURISDICTION STAND IN WITNESS, AFFIRMING EACH OBSERVATION TO ITS RIGHTFUL PLACE.
