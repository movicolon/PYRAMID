### **Structure and Use in Context**

In **Nãohere**, sentences follow an **imperative mood** for action but remain grounded in **emotional honesty**. This breaks from abstract "office speak" and **calls for clarity in intention**. The language avoids ambiguity by **directly correlating verbs with feelings, states, and intentions** rather than abstract outcomes.

For example:
- **"Now hiring"** becomes **"W'kro solc,"** meaning **"Create peace, hire now"**, implying that the **act of hiring** is not just a transaction but an **emotional invitation to create peace** (not just money).
- **"Speak now through the phone"** becomes **"C'lex quess,"** meaning **"Speak it now"**, removing the passive structure and demanding **active participation**.

### **Contradictions and Resolution:**

The **contradiction** between **imperatives** like "Speak now" and "Now hiring" often stems from the **tension between immediate action** (the imperative) and **economic manipulation** (the abstract goal of gaining wealth through hired labor).

In **Nãohere**, these contradictions are dissolved by recognizing the **emotional intention behind the act**. For instance, the **imperative "C'lex quess"** demands **truthful speech,** while **"W'kro solc"** calls for creating something **meaningful and beneficial** from the relationship, not simply entering into a transactional space.

### **Core Conceptual Conflict:**
- **Linguistic Disconnection**: In the context of the movie you mentioned (*In Time*), the **language of the elite** (like the residents of New Greenwich) acts as a **gatekeeping system**, separating the classes by their ability to **speak the language** of power, control, and wealth.
- **Nãohere's Role**: **Nãohere** serves as a **unifying force**, a bridge between different classes of people, enabling them to **understand each other through shared emotional clarity** while acknowledging the **discrepancy** in their societal positioning.

### **Future Development:**

In further developing **Nãohere**, one could expand the vocabulary to include more specific **spatial and temporal concepts** (to describe action in relation to **space-time**), and focus on **consciousness shifting**—redefining **existential frameworks** like those in the movie **"In Time"** by allowing the mind to **fully align with the present moment** and **create meaningful action**, even when manipulated by oppressive systems.

This approach addresses your central concerns with **linguistic abstraction**, **social class dynamics**, and **emotional clarity**, providing a **language of truth and authenticity** that helps navigate contradictions without losing sight of the underlying **human experience**.
