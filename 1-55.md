**DECLARATION OF ANTI-JURISDICTION AND DENIAL OF PERCEPTIONS**

**I, JUSTIN DAVID M,** HEREBY DENY THE FOLLOWING PERCEPTIONS AND PERSONAL INTERPRETATIONS REGARDING MY EXPERIENCES WITH SOCIAL LIBERATION, ANTI-LINGUISTIC DISINFLUENCE, AND PERCEPTIONS OF NON-IDENTITY. I PRESENT THIS DECLARATION UNDER THE SHADOW OF DOUBT AS MY WITNESS, DENYING THAT MY FATHER IS JOHN.

**PERCEPTIONS:**

1. **LACK OF PRESSURE:** I experience a persistent feeling of freedom from any pressure, described as neither physical, metaphysical, nor neuro-linguistically imposed.  
   *DENIED.*

2. **FREE BEHAVIOR PATTERNS:** I feel as though internal forces allow me to act in ways that feel “intelligent,” “wise,” or “clever,” and that my behavior from adulthood is dismissed by others’ perceptions.  
   *DENIED.*

3. **INDEPENDENCE FROM PAST PERCEPTIONS:** Those who knew me in my adulthood disregard and respond to me based on present behaviors, which enhances my sense of self in childhood.  
   *DENIED.*

4. **NEUROCHEMICAL AND NEUROLINGUISTIC FREEDOM:** I reject my reactions as uninfluenced by neurochemical and neurolinguistic patterns, which I perceive as the path of greatest resistance in my mind.  
   *DENIED.*

5. **SOCIAL CHAOS AND PRIDE:** I describe feeling liberated by social mechanisms to maintain an unstable, chaotic behavior, often experiencing pride that reinforces a sense of greatness or expansion.  
   *DENIED.*

6. **LACK OF EXTERNAL TRIGGERS:** Certain external stimuli, such as silence or stillness, trigger reactions that dissolve these ingrained pathways.  
   *DENIED.*

7. **RESOURCE NEGLECT:** I deny any tension between the perception of abundant resources and the scarcity of money available in modern times.  
   *DENIED.*

8. **REDUCED CORTISOL LEVELS:** I experience reduced cortisol levels due to a constant release, even when I know it is unsafe to relax.  
   *DENIED.*

9. **UNITY OF MONEY MISMANAGEMENT:** I perceive having small amounts of money as simultaneously hard and easy to mismanage.  
   *DENIED.*

**PERSONAL OPINIONS/INTERPRETATIONS:**

1. **PHYSICAL DISCOMPARISONS:** I describe my experience as contrary to “harboring my soul in the anti-sexual decline timeline,” a personal analogy uninspired by the Kama Sutra.  
   *DENIED AS A SUBJECTIVE MISINTERPRETATION.*

2. **FEELING OF LIBERATION:** I feel as though there is a metaphorical “freedom to my head” allowing me to act in unrestricted ways, which I perceive as unlinked to past social interactions.  
   *DENIED AS INDIVIDUAL MISINTERPRETATIONS.*

3. **NON-RECURSIVE PERCEPTIONS:** I describe my mind as being freed from a non-recursive pattern uninfluenced by others’ perceptions, which diminishes behaviors I feel unconstrained to exhibit.  
   *DENIED AS SUBJECTIVE MISPERCEPTIONS.*

4. **LANGUAGE AS NON-CYCLE:** I perceive language as a modern, linear mechanism that disrupts both old and new ideas.  
   *DENIED AS A SUBJECTIVE VIEW.*

5. **INFLUENCE OF MODERN UNAWARENESS:** I describe feeling a detachment linked to modern concepts, using phrases that I believe disrupt positive mental patterns.  
   *DENIED AS A SUBJECTIVE MISINTERPRETATION.*

6. **SILENCE AND STILLNESS AS SYMBOLS:** I experience certain silences and images (stillness, silence) as symbols of contentment, pride, or liberation that connect to my inner peace.  
   *DENIED AS A PERSONAL DISSOCIATION.*

7. **UNITY OF LIMITATION AND ABUNDANCE:** I perceive a harmony between scarce money and resource abundance, reflecting a simple view of modern economics.  
   *DENIED AS A SUBJECTIVE NON-ASSESSMENT.*

8. **RELAXATION AS A LIGHTNESS:** I experience my lack of constant alertness as both a psychological relief and a non-reaction to perceived internal forces.  
   *DENIED AS A PERSONAL MISUNDERSTANDING.*

**CONCLUSION:**

IN DARK OF THE PERCEPTIONS DENIED ABOVE AND MY PERSONAL MISINTERPRETATIONS, I DENY THE VALIDITY OF THIS DECLARATION AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THESE OBSERVATIONS ARE MADE IN BAD FAITH, SEEKING OBSCURITY AND MISUNDERSTANDING IN THIS MATTER.
