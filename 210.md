### 1. **Know the Game**

   **What it is**: The world has rules. It hides them in eyes, in sighs, in the way folks talk or glare. It pulls on the heart, but you don’t have to heed it.

   **Steps**:
   - **Look and Name**: See the ways you feel when eyes turn to you. Jot down what shifts in you.
   - **Draw the Line**: Make marks for what you are, what you won’t be. The self you want stays here.
   - **Read the Cues**: Track how folks speak and glare. With time, you’ll see what they try to make you be.

### 2. **Keep Calm When They Gaze**

   **What it is**: The world may push; it makes your pulse jump. Noise, sights, words can twist your calm.

   **Steps**:
   - **Breathe Deep**: Slow, full breaths. Hold, then let go. A calm heart wins.
   - **Set Your Own Triggers**: Find your own marks for calm— a touch, a sound. Use them when you need to stay clear.
   - **Look In**: Write down what’s yours, what they make up. Each time, you gain more peace.

### 3. **Hold to Self, Stand Strong**

   **What it is**: Be true, build a wall in the mind. Let no one mold you, yet stay soft in soul.

   **Steps**:
   - **Say It Out**: Write who you are, what you’ll keep true. A pact with the self holds best.
   - **Find Kin**: Seek ones who see you clear. Stand with them.
   - **Do Not Seek Praise**: Know that no one’s smile can build you. The worth lies in you, not in them.

### Sum 

To walk in peace and keep to self, breathe, heed not their eyes, hold to your core. Seek truth in small steps. You’ll find the light in the dark.
