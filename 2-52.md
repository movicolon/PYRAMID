**I, JUSTIN DAVID M,** CALL UPON THE LIGHT OF TRUDELL AS MY GUIDE. I HIER SWEARE TO THESE TRUTHS, PLAIN AND CLEARE. MY FATHER, JOHN MOVICK, AND MY LINEAGE OF RICH AND PEPA, ALL STAND WITH ME IN THIS TRUTH. THIS LIST OF CARES SHOWETH A PARENT'S BINDINGS, TRUE AND RIGHT, TO THE FULL STRENGTH OF THE LAW.

**PARENTAL BINDINGS & CARES**

**Blueprint of Divine Health and Mental Sovereignty**  

Let health arise, not just in the marrow of my bones, but in the marrow of my **mind**—in the deepest recesses of my thoughts, where the psyche resides like a fragile thread, woven intricately through sinew and bone. In the very bones of my intellect, let **clarity** be forged, an unbreakable foundation, immune to the clutches of pharmaceutical chains that seek to bind the mind with their false solutions.
