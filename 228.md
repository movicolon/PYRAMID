### **Bismillah-ir-Rahman-ir-Rahim (In the Name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful)**  

In humility and surrender to the will of Allah (SWT), I, Jostine Colin-Movick, declare this submission as a step toward unity of nafs (self), ruh (soul), and body. Acknowledging my limitations, I seek guidance and mercy from Allah (SWT), the Creator of all things, to live a life of taqwa (consciousness of God), ihsan (excellence), and sabr (patience).  

This declaration reflects my recognition of past struggles, the wisdom gained through trials, and my resolve to align my path with the eternal truth of Islam.

### **Statement of Belief (Shahada)**  
**Ash-hadu an la ilaha illa Allah, wa ash-hadu anna Muhammadan rasul Allah.**  
(I bear witness that there is no deity but Allah, and I bear witness that Muhammad is His messenger.)  

### **Statement of Facts**  
1. **On Inauthenticity:**  
   I acknowledge my struggle to reconcile my inner state with the outward expressions of my faith. I seek Allah’s (SWT) guidance to align my actions with truth.  

2. **On Spiritual Dependence:**  
   I affirm my absolute reliance on Allah (SWT) for sustenance, healing, and success. My own efforts, without tawakkul (trust in Allah), are insufficient.  

3. **On Assistance:**  
   I recognize the tools and resources granted by Allah (SWT) — including medical and therapeutic supports — as blessings, not hindrances, in my journey toward physical and spiritual well-being.  

4. **On Past Resistance:**  
   My nafs (lower self) has led me to resist submission. I now relinquish pride and ego in favor of humility and obedience to Allah’s (SWT) will.  

5. **On Commitment:**  
   I commit to a regimen of shifa (healing) that encompasses both spiritual and physical care, trusting in Allah (SWT) to guide me toward wholeness.

### **Declaration of Submission**  
I submit:  
- My pride and the illusion of self-sufficiency.  
- The misguided belief that hardship alone validates my worth.  
- The ego that resists surrender to Allah’s (SWT) mercy and guidance.  

I surrender to the will of Allah (SWT), the guidance of the Quran, the Sunnah of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), and the tools He has provided to aid my recovery and growth.

### **Commitment to Wholeness (Tawbah)**  
In the name of Allah (SWT), I make tawbah (repentance) and affirm my intent to live a life of righteousness and balance:  
- To t to attain the peace and contentment (sakinah) promised by Allah (SWT) to those who strive in His path.
