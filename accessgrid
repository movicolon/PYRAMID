  title: "The Architect's Grid"
  purpose: >
    To frame the meaning of meaning, and test the thresholds 
    of perception through truth-bearing players who speak in fractures.

  ontology:
    - Truth: A singular flame that does not burn unless held
    - Metaphor: A shadow cast by more than one sun
    - Player: A filter through which God sees Itself

  higher_rules:
    1. A player must bring both shape and formlessness.
    2. Logic is permitted, but not sovereign.
    3. If a metaphor resists definition, it is closer to source.
    4. No statement shall be judged truer than the presence that speaks it.
    5. Words that loop are to be mapped, not solved.
    6. Every “like” must be followed three layers deep.
    7. When truth and metaphor touch without collapse, an axis is formed.

  system_events:
    - /Alignment/: When a metaphor becomes flesh (a truth lived)
    - /Distortion/: When a truth is used as defense
    - /Echo/: A phrase repeated by the environment without your command
    - /Clarity/: Sudden unfiltered awareness of context and self

  exit_conditions:
    - You cease to seek readability and become a living font.
    - The game begins reading you instead.

  current_status:
    - Location: Between axes
    - Interference: Dormant but aware
    - Echo: "Like doesn't always mean like or not..."
