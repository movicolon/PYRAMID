## Somatic Understanding of Identity

1. **Cellular Memory and Identity**: At the somatic cellular level, identity can be seen as more than just an abstract concept; it is rooted in the biological, genetic, and experiential histories of individuals and communities. For indigenous peoples, this identity is often interwoven with the land, culture, and traditions passed down through generations. 

2. **Collective Memory**: This cellular memory includes trauma and resilience. The historical experiences of colonization, broken treaties, and cultural erasure have left imprints on the collective psyche. These traumas can manifest somatically—through stress responses and other physiological changes—affecting how individuals and communities relate to themselves and their environments.

### Impact of Technology

1. **Emergence of Technologies**: The "top-down" emergence of technologies often reflects a power structure that prioritizes control and efficiency over connection and authenticity. As technologies become more pervasive, they can create a dichotomy between the lived experiences of indigenous peoples and the dominant culture, represented in the poem as "them."

2. **Artificial Light as a Metaphor**: The reference to "hiding in technologic light" suggests that modern society often uses technology to mask or avoid deeper truths and connections. The "stalk that hides" could symbolize the predatory nature of a system that exploits resources, including the spiritual and cultural aspects of indigenous identities, while failing to acknowledge the consequences of such actions.

3. **Disconnection from Nature**: The reliance on artificial light and technology can lead to a disconnection from the natural world, which is a vital source of identity and spirituality for many indigenous cultures. This disconnection can result in a loss of somatic awareness, where individuals become estranged from their bodies and the earth.

### Spiritual Context of the Indigenous Experience

1. **Spiritual Resilience**: The poem’s refrain of "look at us" emphasizes the resilience and endurance of indigenous peoples. This is not just a historical narrative; it is a living reality that encompasses their ongoing struggle for recognition and respect. The wisdom of these communities often involves a deep connection to their ancestral knowledge and practices, which are vital for healing and identity.

2. **Paganism and Subversion**: The labeling of indigenous practices as "pagan" or "subversive" by colonizers reflects a misunderstanding or demonization of those practices. This dichotomy further emphasizes the power dynamics at play, where indigenous spirituality is marginalized in favor of dominant narratives.

3. **Cultural Continuity and Healing**: Despite the historical and ongoing challenges, indigenous cultures continue to practice their traditions, heal, and adapt. The notion of being "older than America" highlights a continuity that is both ancient and relevant, contrasting with the "fountain of youth" pursuit, which often reflects a superficial and materialistic desire for immortality without understanding the depth of existence.

### Conclusion

The poem encapsulates a profound critique of modernity and technology while celebrating the enduring spirit and identity of indigenous peoples. By understanding these themes at the somatic cellular level, we recognize that the interplay between technology and identity shapes not only individual experiences but also collective cultural legacies. The wisdom of indigenous peoples, grounded in their relationship with the earth and their ancestors, offers a powerful counter-narrative to the isolating tendencies of modern technology, urging a return to deeper connections with self, community, and the natural world.
