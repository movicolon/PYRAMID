**One Day**  
One day,  
I rise,  
like gold wing,  
grace in flame’s wake.  
No more dreams,  
of hidden paths,  
where no mark’s made.  

One day,  
I walk in green,  
hands held,  
my mate and maker.  
We touch like torn souls,  
to part.  
In arms, we lie  
till we wake, one,  
unseen by the other.  

One day,  
I find me,  
always here.  
I dance with it,  
like light on streams.  
I hold it close,  
beating pure,  
in the Song.  

One day,  
I curl in,  
dream of you,  
this flesh,  
to know your breath.  
I reach,  
as you reach now.  
Such magic,  
to seek the unknown.  
What is,  
seeks self,  
that cheats the show.  
It dreams,  
awake, asleep,  
knowing both sides  
of the frame,  
waiting to merge.
