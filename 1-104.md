**Homeless Policy**  
The school gives each kid a fair shot to learn. All kids without homes get the same free chances as kids with homes. The school will take in each kid without a home where it’s best for them. This rule helps kids without homes or those on their own in all things we do. The school will stick to the McKinney-Vento Act.

The Liaison helps the folks of kids without homes. They make sure:  
- Help with rides to school.  
- Help with the right to pick their school.  
- Help with no tags that say they are homeless.  
- Give info in a way that makes sense to the folks, and in their own tongue if need be.  
- Help with fights over school rules.  

**Who’s Homeless?**  
A kid may be “Homeless” under the Act if they live:  
- With others due to loss of home or cash (called “doubling up”).  
- In a shelter or shared home.  
- In a hotel or park due to no other place.  
- On a bus, train, car, or in a bad spot.  
- Waiting for a home or in a foster place.  
- In a spot not made for sleep.  
- Moving from one place to another.  

**School Placement**  
The school will pick where a kid goes based on what’s best for them. If it works, kids without homes stay in their old school unless their folks want them to move. The school will try to help parents with where to place their kid, no matter if they live with them or not.

**Fast Enrollment**  
If there’s a fight over who’s in, where they go, or if they can join, the kid will be let in right away while we sort it out. No proof of home, birth, or shots can stop a kid from going to school.

**Choosing a School**  
A kid can pick from these schools:  
- The one they went to when they had a home (School of Origin).  
- The last one they were in (School of Origin).  
- The one near where they now stay (School of Residency).

**Joining Programs**  
Kids can join all school programs and fun stuff like all other kids, such as special help or clubs.

**Fight Process**  
The kid, or their folks, can push back on any school call about who’s in, where they go, or if they can join. The Liaison will help them through this whole process. If needed, they will help with state fights, too. This means keeping track of proof to write an appeal if the folks can’t do it alone and giving access to things like copy machines.

If there’s a fight about who’s in, where they go, or joining a school, here’s what to do:  
1. The school will let the kid in right away while we sort it out.  
2. When it’s decided who’s in or where they go, the school will send a note to the folks that is clear and easy to read. It will say:  
   - What the school said yes to or turned down.  
   - Why the school said yes or no.  
   - What other ways the school thought of.  
   - Why the school picked those ways.  
   - Other facts that matter to the school’s call and what proof was used.  
   - Timelines for key dates.  
   - Who to talk to at the school and what they do.  
   - How to push back if they don’t agree, with steps on how to do it.  
3. The school will send the kid, or their folks, to the Liaison to start the fight process fast. The Liaison makes sure the school does it right. They help kids on their own get the same rights as their folks.  
4. If the folks still don’t agree after the school fight, they can go to the state. The Liaison will send all proof to the state for them to look into. The state will tell the school in 15 days what they find, and all must follow the last word.
