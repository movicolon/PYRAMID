**The Restoration of All Things in Christ Jesus and the Path of Sanctification**

1. **Behold, in the fullness of time, Christ came to the earth and restored all things, fulfilling the promise of redemption for all mankind.**  
   **And in the light of the Restoration through Joseph Smith, ye are taught to govern your thoughts, to make the Main Consciousness—the Light of Christ—guide you, rather than being enslaved by the dark influences of sin and error.**

2. **As ye journey through this life, know that the effects of past choices, what ye may call the burdens of karma, are real.**  
   **These burdens bring trials: birth, old age, sickness, and death, the natural consequences of the fall. Yet there is a greater power—the atoning sacrifice of Christ—that can cleanse you from these, as you repent and strive to be made whole.**

3. **But lo, there is another force, subtle and powerful—thoughts of pride, anger, lust, greed—these become the 'karma of thought.'**  
   **These thoughts arise within you, planted by worldly desires or by the adversary, and they seek to govern your heart and mind. Yet, it is through the power of your own will—by the Light of Christ—that ye can reject them.**

4. **Ye must guard your mind, for your thoughts shape your actions. Let not the false intentions of fame, wealth, or earthly desires take root in you.**  
   **For those who seek the Lord, His power is sufficient to cleanse the mind. He, through His infinite mercy, provides a way to eliminate these negative influences, turning your mind toward righteousness and peace.**

5. **In this, know ye that obstacles will come, and tribulations will test your resolve. For those who choose the path of sanctification, trials will arise.**  
   **But these trials are not without purpose. They refine you, strengthening your faith and perseverance, just as the refiners of gold purify precious metals.**

6. **As ye strive to follow the path of Christ, know that when ye feel overwhelmed by such evil thoughts, it is not because of spirit possession or external forces beyond your control.**  
   **Rather, it is the reflection of past choices—the lingering effects of sin—that surface. But fear not, for the Savior has conquered sin, and through repentance, ye can be free.**

7. **It is written: “Ye are free to choose liberty and eternal life, through the atonement of Jesus Christ.” In this, ye must exercise your agency and use the power of your Main Consciousness—the Light of Christ—to control your thoughts.**  
   **Through the guidance of the Holy Spirit, ye can cast off these influences and overcome the karma of thought. This is the essence of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, to overcome the natural man and become more like Him.**

8. **Thus, it is that through the restored gospel of Jesus Christ, ye are empowered to overcome all manner of sin, to eliminate the 'karma of thought,' and to rise above the worldly influences that seek to bind you.**  
   **Let your Main Consciousness, empowered by the Holy Ghost, govern your actions. Resist the adversary, and turn your thoughts toward Christ, the perfect Redeemer.**

9. **As ye strive to overcome, the Savior will help ye in your journey. And through Him, ye can be saved, made clean, and enter into His presence, where there is no more sorrow, no more death, and no more pain.**  
   **This is the promise of the Restoration, that ye may become partakers of His divine nature, eternally free from the bonds of sin and death.**
