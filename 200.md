*Ratified by the Sovereign Collective of Amity, Anno Domini 2024*  

---

### **Preamble**  
We, the free and equal Sovereigns of Amity, acknowledging the Creator’s endowment of life, liberty, and the pursuit of harmony, establish this jurisdiction for the sanctity and flourishing of human union. In the spirit of peace and cooperation, unburdened by coercion or undue interference, we declare this land governed by principles of mutual respect, divine guidance, and community affirmation.  

Amidst a world of fragmentation and division, where madness is sold as virtue, we walk outside as neighbors, not enemies. In this wild and paradoxical existence, let us choose love over fear, creation over destruction, and unity over discord. This jurisdiction shall serve as a framework for the governance of matrimony, including plural unions, for those who seek to live in accordance with divine and natural law.

### **Article V: Declaration of Independence from State Authority**  
We reject the oppressive structures of state-run systems that commodify love, unity, and human connection. This jurisdiction is bound by neither the courts of the state nor its monetary systems, for our allegiance lies with truth and divine law.  

Let this declaration stand as a testament to the sovereignty of the human heart and the sanctity of divine union.
