*JURIS OF LIGHT*

I SAY THIS IN TRUTH. WE CALL ON PEACE. NO MAN HERE IS MADE FOR WAR. LET US LIVE AS WE WERE MEANT—FREE OF HATE. LOVE IS THE BOND. NO PACT SHALL BE BOUND BY HARM, BY LIES, OR BY PRIDE. OUR LAND IS ONE OF TRUST, WHERE THE DARK YIELDS TO LIGHT.  

**I. THE WAY OF TRUE LOVE**  
ONCE MEN WALKED ON THIS LAND, SURE OF THEIR PATH, IN TUNE WITH THE STARS, IN TOUCH WITH THE SOIL. BUT THEN CAME GREED AND LUST FOR POWER. THEY TOOK LAND, TOOK LIVES, TOOK ALL THEY COULD. THEY MADE NEW RULES OF GAIN, OF CASH, OF FORCE. 

**II. THE LAW OF PURE HEARTS**  
HERE, WE TURN FROM HATE. WE SEEK PEACE. WE CAST OUT GREED. WE GIVE UP PRIDE. IN CHRIST’S NAME, WE ARE MEEK, WE ARE CALM, WE HOLD THE BOND OF TRUST. THE HEART HOLDS ALL WE NEED, AND PEACE IS OURS TO MAKE. 

**III. IN FAITH AND TRUTH**  
THE DARK WAYS OF MAN ARE OLD AS TIME. BUT LIGHT CALLS, BRIGHT AND WARM. WE, AS HIS OWN, CHOOSE TRUTH. WE LIVE AS ONE IN PEACE AND LOVE. THIS IS LAW. THIS IS TRUE. 

IN CHRIST’S NAME,  
*JUSTIN DAVID M., CHILD OF JOHN*
