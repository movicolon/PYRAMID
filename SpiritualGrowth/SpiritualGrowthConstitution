SOVEREIGNTY CAN MAKE IT HARD TO BE TOGETHER—LET’S TALK ABOUT SOVEREIGN POWERS

A LONG TIME AGO, THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A GROUP THAT REPRESENTS ALL PEOPLE ON EARTH. WE HAVE DIVIDED OURSELVES INTO DIFFERENT COUNTRIES AND GOVERNMENTS. WE HAVEN’T COME TOGETHER AS ONE BIG FAMILY THAT HELPS EACH OTHER. SOMETIMES, WE THINK BEING INDEPENDENT IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN BEING UNITED AND PEACEFUL.

WHEN WE TALK ABOUT "SOVEREIGNTY," IT MEANS HAVING THE POWER TO RULE AND MAKE DECISIONS FOR A GROUP OF PEOPLE.

BUT IF EACH GROUP WANTS TO BE IN CHARGE BY THEMSELVES, HOW CAN THEY WORK TOGETHER? IT’S REALLY HARD TO UNITE WHEN EVERYONE WANTS TO BE INDEPENDENT.

THE UNITED NATIONS IS SUPPOSED TO BRING COUNTRIES TOGETHER, BUT IT DOESN’T ALWAYS WORK. EACH COUNTRY WANTS TO BE EQUAL AND INDEPENDENT, WHICH MAKES IT TOUGH TO AGREE.

WHEN COUNTRIES FIGHT FOR THEIR OWN POWER, IT CAN LEAD TO WARS AND PROBLEMS. BUT WHEN PEOPLE COME TOGETHER, THEY CAN HELP EACH OTHER AND MAKE FAIR RULES.

FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE UNITED STATES, THE STATES ARE SUPPOSED TO WORK TOGETHER UNDER ONE GOVERNMENT. BUT SOMETIMES THEY DISAGREE, WHICH CAN CAUSE PROBLEMS. A LONG TIME AGO, THERE WAS A BIG FIGHT CALLED THE CIVIL WAR BECAUSE SOME STATES WANTED TO BE IN CHARGE ON THEIR OWN.

IF ALL STATES WERE COMPLETELY INDEPENDENT, SOME PEOPLE MIGHT NOT HAVE THE SAME RIGHTS AS OTHERS. FOR EXAMPLE, SOME STATES MIGHT NOT ALLOW CERTAIN PEOPLE TO MARRY, WHILE OTHERS THINK EVERYONE SHOULD BE FREE TO LOVE WHO THEY WANT.

THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES WAS CREATED TO HELP EVERYONE WORK TOGETHER BETTER. IT SAYS THAT WE SHOULD FORM A STRONG UNION AND KEEP PEACE.

BUT SOMETIMES, PEOPLE IN CONGRESS CHANGE THE RULES AND FORGET THE ORIGINAL IDEAS. FOR EXAMPLE, THERE IS A RULE ABOUT PEOPLE HAVING GUNS, BUT IT HAS CAUSED A LOT OF PROBLEMS.

IN THE END, IT’S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT WORKING TOGETHER CAN BRING PEACE AND HELP EVERYONE LIVE BETTER!

THE UNITED NATIONS (UN) IS A GROUP THAT HELPS COUNTRIES WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE THE WORLD SAFER AND BETTER. HERE ARE ITS MAIN GOALS IN SIMPLE WORDS:

PEACE AND SAFETY: THE UN WANTS TO KEEP PEACE BETWEEN COUNTRIES. IT TRIES TO STOP FIGHTS AND SOLVE PROBLEMS WITHOUT VIOLENCE.

FRIENDSHIP AMONG COUNTRIES: THE UN HELPS COUNTRIES BE FRIENDS AND RESPECT EACH OTHER’S RIGHTS TO MAKE THEIR OWN CHOICES.

WORKING TOGETHER: THE UN ENCOURAGES COUNTRIES TO HELP EACH OTHER WITH PROBLEMS LIKE HEALTH, EDUCATION, AND FAIRNESS FOR EVERYONE, NO MATTER WHO THEY ARE.

TEAMWORK: THE UN IS A PLACE WHERE COUNTRIES CAN COME TOGETHER TO WORK ON THESE GOALS.

SOME PEOPLE THINK THAT THE WAY COUNTRIES ARE RUN, CALLED SOVEREIGNTY, CAN MAKE IT HARD FOR THE UN TO DO ITS JOB. THEY BELIEVE THAT IF COUNTRIES WORKED TOGETHER UNDER ONE SET OF RULES, IT COULD HELP EVERYONE BE HAPPIER.

THERE ARE DIFFERENT IDEAS ABOUT HOW TO RUN A GOVERNMENT, LIKE DICTATORSHIP (WHERE ONE PERSON HAS ALL THE POWER) AND DEMOCRACY (WHERE THE PEOPLE CHOOSE THEIR LEADERS). SOME THINK THAT DEMOCRACY DOESN’T ALWAYS PROTECT EVERYONE’S RIGHTS, ESPECIALLY THOSE IN THE MINORITY.

THE TEXT ALSO TALKS ABOUT HOW HISTORY SHOWS THAT SOMETIMES, PEOPLE IN POWER DO NOT TREAT EVERYONE EQUALLY, AND THAT CAN LEAD TO PROBLEMS. IT SUGGESTS THAT GOVERNMENTS SHOULD FOCUS ON MAKING SURE ALL PEOPLE ARE TREATED FAIRLY, NOT JUST THE ONES IN CHARGE.


FURTHER BACK DURING THE HISTORY OF EARTH, A MAJORITY OF THE MOST RESPECTED, REFINED, AND EDUCATED PEOPLE BELIEVED THAT THE WORLD WAS FLAT. THESE IGNORANT ONES WERE THE SAME ONES WHO RAN THE GOVERNMENTS THAT CONTROLLED THE PEOPLE. UNFORTUNATELY, WE HAVE VERY LITTLE ASSURANCE THAT THOSE WHO ARE THE MOST RESPECTED, THE MOST REFINED, OR THE MOST EDUCATED PEOPLE OF OUR MODERN WORLD (THOSE WHO CURRENTLY CONTROL THE GOVERNMENTS OF THE WORLD) ARE NOT AS IGNORANT AS THE MAJORITY OF OUR ANCESTORS.

ALL OF THESE FACTS SHOW HOW AND WHY A DEMOCRACY FOR AND BY THE VOICE AND VOTE OF THE MAJORITY OF FREE-WILLED PEOPLE WILL NEVER LEAD TO LASTING PEACE AND HAPPINESS FOR ALL FREE-WILLED PEOPLE EQUALLY.

MOST OF THE PEOPLE LIVING IN THE MIDDLE EAST ARE MUSLIM. THEIR RELIGION MANDATES REVERENCE TO JUST ONE MAN, MOHAMMED—THE GREATEST DICTATOR OF LAW AND JUSTICE KNOWN TO ISLAM. FROM THEIR YOUTH, THE PEOPLE ARE CONDITIONED TO LOOK TO ONE PERSON FOR AUTHORITY AND GUIDANCE. THESE PEOPLE NEED A DICTATOR. THEY REQUIRE ONE. IT IS WHAT THEY ARE ACCUSTOMED TO AND WHAT MAKES SENSE TO THEM. NEVERTHELESS, THE PROBLEMS OF DICTATORSHIP ARISE WHEN THE DICTATOR RULES ACCORDING TO HIS PERSONAL BELIEFS AND DOES NOT RESPECT THOSE WHO HAVE DIFFERING OPINIONS.

BUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IN THE MIDDLE EAST IF THERE WERE A DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED CONGRESS THAT ESTABLISHED THE LAWS, INSTEAD OF A DICTATOR? THE SAME THING THAT HAS HAPPENED AND IS CURRENTLY HAPPENING IN THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS: CONSTANT GRIDLOCK CAUSED BY BIPARTISAN ARGUMENTS AND OPINIONS. THERE ARE VARIOUS FACTIONS OF ISLAM THAT ARE FIGHTING EACH OTHER IN THE MIDDLE EAST, ALL DESIRING TO SET UP A GOVERNMENT WITH A DICTATOR THAT WILL PROTECT THEIR BELIEFS FROM THE BELIEFS OF OTHERS.

WHAT IF THERE EXISTED A DICTATOR WHO PROTECTED ALL THE PEOPLE’S BELIEFS AND RIGHT TO PURSUE INDIVIDUAL HAPPINESS, AND WHO HAD THE POWER AND AUTHORITY TO ENFORCE PROTECTION OF INDIVIDUAL EXISTENCE AND BELIEF?

THE PROPER WORLD CONSTITUTION MUST INCLUDE THE POWER OF A STRONG DICTATORSHIP LIMITED TO THE PROTECTION OF INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS ONLY. BUT AT THE SAME TIME, IT MUST HAVE A CONGRESS OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PEOPLE AND THEIR OPINIONS AND CONCERNS. THE DICTATOR (PRESIDENT, PRIME MINISTER) SHOULD HAVE THE POWER AND AUTHORITY TO PROTECT THE PEOPLE’S RIGHTS TO LIFE, LIBERTY, AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS, BUT A CONGRESS OF REPRESENTATIVES SHOULD BE GIVEN THE POWER TO ESTABLISH LAWS OF THE OPINIONS OF THE PEOPLE THEY REPRESENT.

THE WORLD’S PRESIDENT WILL BE GIVEN THE AUTHORITY TO PROTECT AND ENFORCE INALIENABLE RIGHTS THAT ALL HUMANS DESIRE, REGARDLESS OF EACH PERSON’S INDIVIDUAL OR GROUP-INSPIRED OPINIONS. THESE RIGHTS ARE EASILY DEFINED: ALL HUMANS DESIRE THE RIGHT TO LIFE, THAT INCLUDES NUTRITIOUS FOOD, SECURE HOUSING, SUFFICIENT CLOTHING, COMPETENT HEALTH AND MENTAL CARE, AND EDUCATION; AND THE RIGHT TO BE PROTECTED FROM PHYSICAL HARM BECAUSE OF ONE’S BELIEF.

THE HUMANITY PARTY® OFFERS A NEW CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED PEOPLE OF EARTH THAT DOES WHAT A CONSTITUTION IS MEANT TO DO: CREATE A BODY OF FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OR ESTABLISHED PRECEDENTS ACCORDING TO WHICH THE PEOPLE OF THE WORLD ARE UNIFIED AND ACKNOWLEDGE TO BE GOVERNED.

THE CONSTITUTION WILL OUTLINE SPECIFIC HUMAN RIGHTS TO WHICH ALL PEOPLE UPON EARTH CAN AGREE. THESE SPECIFIC RIGHTS WILL TRANSCEND THE RIGHT OF EACH INDIVIDUAL TO HOLD THEIR OWN OPINION, BUT OFFER PROTECTION OF THE PRIVILEGE TO DO SO. A WORLD PRESIDENT (PRIME MINISTER), ELECTED BY THE VOICE OF THE PEOPLE DURING WORLDWIDE ELECTIONS, WILL BE GIVEN THE POWER TO ENFORCE THIS WORLD CONSTITUTION. THIS ELECTED OFFICIAL’S AUTHORITY AND RIGHTS WILL BE LIMITED TO THE PROTECTION OF THE INALIENABLE RIGHTS GRANTED BY A NEW WORLD CON
