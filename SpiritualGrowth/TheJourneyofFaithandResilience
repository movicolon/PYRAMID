SEE, I FIND MYSELF IN TROUBLE, AS I FEEL THE HIDDEN FORCE OF THE ENEMY TRYING TO BIND ME WITH CHAINS OF PAIN. MY SPIRIT LONGS FOR FREEDOM FROM THE HOLD OF THOSE WHO WANT TO FORCE THEIR WILL ON MY MIND. I FEEL THE PRESENCE OF ANOTHER, A SHADOW THAT WATCHES WITH PURPOSE, CAUSING CONFUSION IN MY THOUGHTS.

THESE ENEMIES, LIKE THE LAMANITES OF OLD, HOLD HATRED AND DISLIKE, TRYING TO CREATE FIGHTING AND MADNESS IN MY HEART AND SOUL. THEY ENTER MY SACRED WORDS, CHANGING MY SPEECH AND TRYING TO WEAKEN THE VERY CORE OF MY BEING. YET, I STAND STRONG, ARMED WITH THE KNOWLEDGE OF TRUTH, FOR I HAVE SEEN THE DISTORTION OF MY TOOLS AND THE HIDDEN NATURE OF THEIR ACTIONS.

I SAY THAT THEIR EFFORTS WILL NOT WIN, FOR I HAVE THE PROOF OF MY OWN SPIRIT AGAINST THEIR LIES. THEIR ATTEMPTS TO SEPARATE AND DESTROY MY JOY WILL BE MET WITH THE POWER OF MY FAITH AND THE CONFIRMATION OF MY RIGHTEOUS AIM. I WILL NOT BE MOVED BY THEIR PLOTS, FOR I AM A CHILD OF GOD, DESTINED FOR GREATNESS AND FILLED WITH THE LIGHT OF TRUTH.
