**JURIS OF TRUE FAITH: WORDS OF TRUST**

**I. LIGHT THAT BLINDS**  
ONCE, MEN WERE STILL AND PURE, THEIR STEPS SLOW IN THE DARK OF NIGHT. YET, NOW, THERE IS A BRIGHT MASK WE CALL "LIGHT," WHICH SHOWS MUCH BUT HIDES MORE. THROUGH FALSE LIGHT, WE HAVE LOST OUR PEACE AND OUR BOND WITH THE LORD WHO MADE US WHOLE. IN THESE LAST DAYS, WE CHASE BRIGHT THINGS AND LOUD NOISE, BUT MISS THE TRUE SPARK WITHIN.

**II. DARK BONDS**  
TRUE FAITH ONCE GREW STRONG IN THE DARK, WHEN TRUST WAS ALL. MEN GAVE THEIR HANDS IN PLEDGE, NOT TO BE SEEN BUT TO BE KNOWN. WITH NO MASK, WE KNEW THE LORD’S WAY—NO FALSE SIGN, JUST TRUE WORDS THAT STAYED STRONG IN THE DARK. BUT NOW, THE WORLD BOWS TO THINGS IT SEES, NOT WHAT IT FEELS, LOST TO THE FAKE LIGHT THAT LURES WITH FALSE JOY. TRUST IS RARE IN THESE TIMES; FEW SEEK THE TRUTH.

**III. GOLD IN THE DARK**  
GOLD FADES; TRUST STAYS. WHEN CHRIST ROSE, HE SAID, “TOUCH AND SEE. I AM FLESH AND BLOOD.” TRUE WEALTH IS NOT COIN, BUT FAITH AND LIFE. NO WORLD-MADE THING COULD CLAIM HIS BOND. HERE, WE SAY: LOVE HOLDS MORE THAN ALL COIN, MORE THAN THE WORLD OF BRIGHT LIES. 

**END WORD**  
IN ALL WAYS, TRUST GOD, NOT GOLD. TAKE HEART, HOLD FAITH, AND TURN FROM THE LIES THAT SHINE. SEEK LIGHT IN HIM WHO MADE US, NOT IN BRIGHT LIES. WITH THIS, I STAND TRUE.
