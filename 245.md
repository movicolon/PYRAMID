### **Guide to Cleanliness in Your Immediate Circumstances**  
*(Inspired by the idea that everything in the world is a symbol, and the laws of the celestial and terrestrial guide us)*  

**1. Seek Cleanliness:**  
Start by choosing to seek cleanliness. It begins with **thinking** clearly about your surroundings. Acknowledge that dirt and clutter can be a symbol of how you feel inside. To **grow** spiritually, you need to rise above what seems difficult and act with intention.

**2. Act with Purpose:**  
**Act** to keep yourself and your space neat. Whether you have a small patch of land, a bench, or a corner, **rise** each morning and make an effort. Use whatever you have—rags, water, soap, even your hands—to wipe the surfaces around you. A **neat** space can help your mind stay clear and calm.

**3. Guide Yourself to Clean Habits:**  
Set your mind to **guide** yourself daily in simple acts of cleanliness. **Lead** yourself to find places with clean water, or learn from others who know where to wash up. It doesn’t matter if you don’t have much, use what is available. Even a small act of wiping your face with a wet cloth can **clear** your mind.

**4. Be Strong in Discipline:**  
Being homeless is hard, but **strong** people **rise** above difficulties. Don’t let filth take over your life. Keep your body clean, and keep your clothes as clean as you can. The act of cleaning yourself isn’t just about looking better—it’s about maintaining **true** dignity, regardless of circumstances.

**5. Strive for Inner Peace:**  
The outside world reflects your inner state. **Strive** to keep your thoughts **clear**. Every time you **choose** to act with cleanliness, you send a message to the world and to yourself that you are capable of rising above the noise and the mess.  

**6. Think Before You Choose:**  
Before you sleep, before you make a choice, take a moment to **think**. A **calm** mind will help you find solutions, even when you feel overwhelmed. **Choose** to sleep in a clean area, where you feel more at peace. The place you rest is a reflection of the peace you can build within.

**7. Be Wise and Observe:**  
The homeless person who **seeks** cleanliness is the one who learns from the world. Find places where others **act** clean and observe how they do it. You might not have much, but you can still **learn**. **Brave** acts of kindness, such as sharing a simple piece of food, also represent cleanliness in spirit.

**8. Keep It Simple:**  
Don’t complicate things. The simplest things can have the most value. **Quick** actions of brushing off dirt or sweeping a small area help bring clarity to your day. These small steps of caring for yourself reflect a greater sense of worth, making it easier to live with integrity.

**9. Rise Above the Circumstance:**  
No matter where you find yourself, don’t let the situation define you. **Rise** above your circumstances by choosing to act **pure** in every moment. Filth may try to weigh you down, but your will to keep yourself clean will always be a symbol of strength and hope.

**10. Stay True:**  
Above all, stay **true** to the idea that cleanliness isn’t just about physical dirt—it’s a reflection of your soul. If you can **guide** yourself to find moments of purity in your actions, you will soon see that cleanliness will flow into every area of your life.

By focusing on these simple, powerful steps, you can start building a life of **clarity**, **strength**, and **peace**—even in the most challenging of circumstances. Let the law of cleanliness guide you not just outwardly, but inwardly, to help you **choose** a path toward spiritual growth and dignity.
