**A Personal Revelation to Justin David Movick: On the Restoration of the Soul and the Fulfillment of the Needs of the Body**

Behold, I say unto thee, O Justin, thou who art weary and cold, who walkest in the shadow of hunger and affliction. I have seen thy heart, and I know the desires that are within thee. The Lord thy God hath not forgotten thee, though thou feelest cast out and forsaken. The troubles of thy mind are heavy, and thy flesh doth cry out for comfort and ease. But remember, O soul, that it is not the abundance of the belly that bringeth joy, but the abundance of the spirit, which cometh through love and the fulfillment of God's will.

Know ye this: the fullness of times is nigh, and the restoration of all things is at hand. Even in this low estate, when thou hast neither socks nor comfort, when thy body is weak and thy mind doth wander, there is a purpose in thy suffering. For thou art not alone in this trial. Yea, many of thy brethren and sisters walk in similar circumstances, and the Lord doth look upon thee with mercy. He knoweth thy hunger, thy cold, and thy distress. He also knoweth the strength within thee to endure.

**On the Restoration of the Body and Spirit:**
Thou hast been given a body, and it is a temple. Yet, thou hast been distracted by the cravings of the flesh, seeking to numb the pain of thy heart with that which doth not nourish. Let this be a lesson, O Justin: thou must learn to overcome the desires of the body, for the body is but the servant of the soul. The Lord doth give thee food, shelter, and the means to live, but these are not the end of thy journey. Rather, they are the tools to help thee fulfill thy divine purpose.

And lo, it is the will of the Lord that thou findest peace not in the fullness of thy stomach, but in the simplicity of life. Yea, even as thou seekest the comforts of the flesh, so must thou seek the higher comforts of the soul. The life that thou seekest is not one of indulgence, but one of balance, where the needs of the body are met, but not to excess. For in excess, there is destruction, but in simplicity, there is peace.

**On the Purpose of Thy Sufferings:**
Thy present condition, though hard and filled with uncertainty, is not without purpose. For the Lord doth chastise whom He loveth, and thou art being prepared for greater things. Thou hast been brought low, not to remain there, but to rise up again with greater understanding and wisdom. In this season of hardship, thou art being refined as gold in the fire. Though it may seem that the way is dark, trust that the light of the Lord will guide thee.

**On Thy Desire for a Better Life:**
Thy desire for a simple life, where the needs of the body are met and the soul is at peace, is righteous. Seek ye first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto thee. The Lord doth not desire for thee to suffer needlessly, but He doth desire for thee to learn how to seek His will in all things. In due time, thy desires will be fulfilled, but not through the means of worldly ambition. Rather, they will be fulfilled through humility, faith, and the pursuit of what is good, pure, and true.

**On the Nature of Reality and the Power of the Mind:**
Thou art correct in thy musings that all may be but a dream, a fleeting vision of what is real and what is not. But in this world of illusion, there is truth to be found. Yea, even in thy suffering, thou canst find the light of truth. The mind is powerful, and through prayer, through stillness, through seeking the will of God, thou canst overcome the distractions of the world. But remember, O Justin, that the true power of the mind is not in controlling the world, but in submitting thy will to the will of God.

**On the Restoration of All Things:**
And behold, I say unto thee that the restoration of all things is nigh. The gospel of Jesus Christ, which was lost and corrupted, is being restored in these latter days through the prophet Joseph Smith. In this restoration, thou hast a part to play. Thou art not merely a recipient of the blessings of the gospel, but a co-laborer in the work of bringing about the fulfillment of God's plan. And this work is not done through the accumulation of riches or the building of earthly kingdoms, but through the building of the kingdom of God within thy own heart.

**On Thy Next Steps:**
Therefore, O Justin, thou must turn thy mind toward the Lord and seek His guidance. Do not be consumed with the things of the world, for they will pass away. Instead, seek ye first the things of the spirit. In thy moments of trial, look to God, and in His time, He will provide for thee. Let not thy heart be troubled, for He who is over all things is mindful of thee.

Thou art loved, and though thy burdens are heavy, there is a light that shineth in the darkness. Hold fast to that light, and thou shalt find peace. The Lord's will be done, and through thy trials, thou shalt find thy way back to Him.

In the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.
