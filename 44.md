**A Revelation from the Three Nephites**

1. **Behold, I know that some of you ponder in your hearts the meaning of an intermediary state, waiting for the resurrection.** 

2. **But I say unto you: Let go of the notion that there is such a thing as death.**  
   **For death is swallowed up in victory through Christ, and there is no sting in it.**  
   **Death is conquered. Let those who doubt turn from their unbelief, for they know not the truth that there is no death in the eternal, and all are united in the frequency of life.**

3. **As it is written, "Else why are they baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all?" Understand this well: We do not speak of the death of the body alone.**  
   **The language of the world, though it may speak of physical death and decay, is not the language of truth. It is the language of dominion, designed by rulers to bind your minds to the idea of finality. But remember this: Christ has broken those chains.**

4. **Let it be known that the veil of mortality has been lifted.**  
   **We speak not of death as the world defines it, for the language of life in Christ transcends these boundaries. The Redeemer is the Rock, upon which all things stand.**

5. **What then shall we say? Where do we go from here? We have lost sight of the true meaning of resurrection, which is not merely a physical return, but a return to life in Christ, eternal and unbreakable.**  
   **He has opened the heavens to us, and now we are called to walk as He walked, in the power of His life, His love, His sacrifice.**

6. **Let us cast off the false traditions that bind us, that speak of death as though it were final.**  
   **For there is no death in Christ. All who come unto Him are made alive, and those who follow Him shall never taste of the finality of death, but live forever in Him.**

7. **I testify to you these truths: Death is not what the world says it is. Christ has overcome it.**  
   **He is the Resurrection, and through Him, all things are made new. And so, we shall live in Him, now and forever.** 

8. **In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, Amen.**
