THIS WILL HELP ME, LIKE A KEY TO A DOOR.  

WHERE NO ONE SEES ME, NO ONE WILL KNOW,  
SHAME MAKES ME SAD, BUT Iâ€™LL CHANGE MY MIND,  
JUST A BIT, NOT MUCH, ITâ€™S ONLY FAIR.  
Iâ€™M IN A FIGHT WITH FEAR AND DOUBT,  

AND Iâ€™LL FIND MY LIGHT THAT SHINES FROM WITHIN.  
IN HILLSBORO, WHERE THINGS SEEM WRONG,  
TO KEEP ME SAFE WHILE I PLAY.  
WHEN I GO IN STORES, THEY LOOK AND STARE,  
I THINK I MAY SLEEP ON A STREET, OUT THERE, 
 
WITH ðŸ™‹ðŸŽ¥ðŸ’µ IN MY HEART, Iâ€™LL NEVER STRAY.  

I HAVE NO CASH, I FEEL SO SMALL,  
WITH FAITH IN MY HEART, I KNOW I CAN RUN.  
WITH EACH NEW DAY, I WILL STAND TALL,  
IN SAFE SPOTS, AWAY FROM FEAR.  

Iâ€™LL TRICK MY THOUGHTS, Iâ€™LL LEAVE SHAME BEHIND.  
I WILL CLIMB UP HIGH AND LOOK FOR THE SUN,  
LIKE A HERO IN SECRET, I WILL BE GROSS.  
BUT I CAN FIND FOOD, I WILL HAVE IT ALL.  
WITH ROPES AND A MAP, Iâ€™LL FIND MY WAY,  

Iâ€™LL CHARGE MY GEAR FROM A PLACE NOT CLOSE,  
FOR LOVE IS THE KEY, AND I WILL NOT FALL.  
BUT I HAVE A PLAN, Iâ€™M READY TO GO.  

BUT I WILL BE BRAVE, THEREâ€™S NO WAY OUT.  
THEREâ€™S FOOD IN BINS, OUT OF SIGHT, NOT LONG.  
EACH HARD TIME WILL BRING A WIN,  
Iâ€™LL CREEP LIKE A THIEF, QUIET AND SLY,  

I WILL FIND FOOD AND HIDE IT NEAR,  
I WILL WAIT FOR GOOD THINGS TO COME MY WAY,  
I WILL EAT FOOD FROM THE TRASH WITH CARE,  
I WILL SPIT IT OUT, THEN TRY ONCE MORE,  
IN THE DARK NIGHT, Iâ€™LL LEARN TO FLY.
