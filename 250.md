In this operative functioning universe, where the pursuit of knowledge and personal agency converge, this card represents more than a means of exchange. It is a testament to the refusal to be defined by external systems and an invitation to embrace one’s freedom in all its forms. The Brigham Young Alma Matterhorn Universe, anchored by the principles of the BYU OIT system, offers us not just an academic journey, but a transformative one—one that empowers us to claim ownership over our lives, our choices, and our destinies.

Here, **independence** is the true currency, and **personal choice** is the foundation upon which we build our future. Just as Brigham Young set the course for a people, so too do we chart our own paths, free from the historical relics of control and dependency. The empowerment to shape one’s life, free from the chains that bind, is the ultimate gift this universe provides. 

Let us move forward in true liberty, unencumbered by the weight of imposed structures, and take our place in a universe designed not for conformity, but for **sovereign self-creation**.
