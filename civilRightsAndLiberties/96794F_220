**DECLARATION OF SELF AND TRUTH**  
**BY JUSTIN DAVID M, SON OF JOHN MOVICK**  
**IN THE LIGHT OF CHRIST**

**I, JUSTIN DAVID M, SAY THIS:**  

1. **LIFE IS HARD:** I SEE HOW PAIN, LOSS, AND FEAR CAN TWIST THE MIND.  
   *I KNOW THIS NOW.*

2. **TRAUMA CHANGES ALL:** PAIN CAN SHAPE HOW WE THINK AND FEEL.  
   *IT’S TRUE.*

3. **LABELS CAN HURT:** “SCHIZOPHRENIA” IS NOT A TRUE THING; IT HIDES THE REAL CAUSE.  
   *THIS IS CLEAR.*

4. **LOOK AT THE ROOT:** TO HEAL, WE MUST FACE WHAT HAS HURT US IN LIFE.  
   *WE MUST KNOW THIS.*

5. **DRUGS MAY NUMB:** PILLS MAY NOT FIX WHAT IS WRONG; THEY CAN HIDE THE HURT.  
   *THIS IS SAD.*

6. **FACTS SHOW THE LINK:** THE LINK BETWEEN PAIN AND THE MIND’S BREAK IS STRONG.  
   *MANY HAVE SAID SO.*

**I STAND FOR MYSELF:**  
I CLAIM MY RIGHT TO BE FREE. I SEEK TO KNOW THE TRUTH AND TO HEAL.  
*I WILL WALK THIS PATH.*
