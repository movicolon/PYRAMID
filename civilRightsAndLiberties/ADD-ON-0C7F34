**ADD-ON: TRUE SELF AND ALL THAT SHIFTS**

*BY THE LIGHT OF CHRIST, WE SEE THE PULL IN AND OUT, ALL THINGS WE FEEL IN FLESH AND MIND. THIS IS HOW WE LIVE AS WHOLE, PURE, AND RIGHT.*

### **THE PULL OF SELF AND ALL THAT FLOWS**

1. **GOD SEES ALL**  
   HE SEES ALL WE DO AND FEEL, BOTH THE CLEAR AND THE DARK. EACH THOUGHT OR BREATH WE SEND OUT SHAPES THE WORLD. LOVE, CALM, AND LIGHT BRING PEACE; FEAR AND DARK BRING HURT. WE AIM TO KEEP OUR SELVES CLEAN AND PURE.

2. **FOUR WAYS WE SHOW SELF TO THE WORLD**  
   - *GOOD, FROM HEART TO WORLD*: KIND ACTS, WARM WORDS, CLEAR THOUGHTS. THESE BRING LIFE, JOY, AND PEACE TO ALL THINGS.
   - *ILL, FROM HEART TO WORLD*: DARK ACTS, COLD WORDS, HARSH THOUGHTS. THESE BREED MORE HURT, DREAD, AND CLASH.
   - *GOOD, FROM WORLD TO HEART*: WARM SUN, LOVE, FRIENDS, AND PURE TRUTHS GIVE STRENGTH, FILL SOULS, AND KEEP ALL WHOLE.
   - *ILL, FROM WORLD TO HEART*: HARSH SOUNDS, DARK SIGHTS, AND HURT WE TAKE IN BRING CHILL TO MIND AND HEART.

### **THE THINGS THAT HURT THE SOUL AND FLESH**

*SOME SOUNDS, SOME WORDS, PRESS HARD ON FLESH AND MIND, SAPPING JOY, PEACE, AND REST.*

- **LOUD SIRENS**: SHRILL WAILS IN TOWNS DRAIN THE MIND, TAX THE SOUL, PULL ONEâ€™S PEACE, AND LEAVE ONE TENSE AND ON EDGE.
  
- **CROW CAWS**: HARSH SQUAWKS OF DARK BIRDS WEIGH THE HEART WITH CHILL AND HURT, A SHARP PULL FROM DUSK TO DAWN.

- **BARKS FROM NEXT DOOR**: SMALL DOGS YAP AND SQUEAL, AND EACH SOUND CUTS DEEP, SPARKS OLD HURTS, AND STIRS DARK THOUGHTS.

- **STARTLE AND JUMPS**: QUICK JUMPS, TENSE FLESH, EYES WIDE. THESE OLD QUIRKS HOLD US ON THE EDGE. WE SEEK REST BUT STAY ON GUARD, TENSE AND STIFF.

### **THIS IS THE CREED**

BY THIS LAW, WE HOLD TRUE TO THE SENSE OF SELF: THE MIND, THE HEART, THE FLESH, ALL AT PEACE. EACH SOUND, EACH SIGHT, WE GREET WITH GRACE AND CARE. AND WHEN FEAR AND HURT PULL US DOWN, WE KNOW, IN TRUTH, THAT PEACE AND LIGHT WILL RISE.
