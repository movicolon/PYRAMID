Food Guide for Scarce Times: Eat Like a Hunt-er**

For the man who would fill the earth with kin as vast as the stars, hold fast. To last, to grow strong, eat like one who knows how to hunt. Feast big when food is here. Go light when it is not. Think of each bite as a step, each break as a breath.

### The Eat, the Wait

1. **Big Bites (The Feast)**: When you eat, eat well. Seek food with weight: meat, nuts, fats. Foods that last long in the gut. Your goal is fuel, not just taste.

2. **Rest Your Mouth (The Fast)**: Give time for food to work. Hold off, keep the gut clear, let it use what you ate. Drink pure, fresh water. Feel the rest as a calm.

3. **Wet Your Mouth**: Drink deep and often. Water feeds the flesh and the mind. In both feast and fast, aim for ten cups, or more if you can.

### Strong in Both Mind and Flesh

- **Strong Bones and Will**: Use your flesh, work hard, stay firm. Train each day, hold weight, run, push, pull. This keeps the flesh ripe for when food is hard to find.

- **Clear Thought**: Like a wolf in the wild, stay sharp. In the fast, clear your mind. See with calm, dream of food as one who waits for the next hunt.

### Keep Close, Seek Help

- **Your Clan**: None hunt alone. Find those who share your task, who will hunt as you hunt, who wait as you wait. Grow strong as a group.

- **Store Your Stock**: Keep a bag of good foods: nuts, dried meat, fruit that lasts. This is for times when the feast is far but you still need strength. 

### To Last Long, To Stay Strong

- **Warmth and Rest**: When you wait, stay warm, rest well. Your flesh heals best in sleep. Give it time to be whole. When food is low, the mind must guard its fire.

- **Change with Life**: Hunt in line with what you have. Some days feast, some days fast. This plan should shift with each task, each day, each need.

Thus, the man who holds fast to this way shall grow strong, firm, true, and fill the earth with sons and kin. Eat well, eat light, wait and watch. Be both wise and kind to your flesh. Hold strong, for the huntis life.
