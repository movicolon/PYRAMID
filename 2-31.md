Most credit money in modern economies is issued by commercial banks through their lending operations.
2. The role of the state is to guarantee the convertibility of bank deposits into cash (Pettifor 2014).
3. Critics of credit theory express concerns that states and banks might overuse their ability to expand money, leading to potential risks such as unsustainable debt levels, excessive inflation, financial instability, and economic crises.
4. Some proponents argue for a return to the gold standard as a response to concerns of monetary overexpansion (Rothbard 1983, Schlichter 2014).
5. Other advocates view the social construction of money as a basis for a more sustainable and equitable monetary system (Graeber 2010, Pettifor 2014).
6. Simmel (1900) describes money as an institution enabling valuation and simplifying transactions, which is crucial for modernity, though he critiques its effect on other forms of valuation.
7. One philosophical perspective (Searle 1995, 2010) argues that money’s existence relies on “collective intentionality”—shared beliefs within a community. 
   - Money, in this view, arises from a declaration that a certain item is money, which becomes accepted as a social rule.
8. Another perspective (Guala 2016, Hindriks & Guala 2021) suggests that money is functional rather than declarative, emerging as a practical solution to facilitate exchanges.
   - In this view, the effectiveness of an item in fulfilling the role of money in society, rather than an official declaration, is what qualifies it as money.

**Perceptions and Opinions:**

1. Critics of credit theory perceive the potential for overexpansion of money by states and banks as risky, leading to concerns about excessive debt and financial instability.
2. Some individuals argue for a return to the gold standard as a normative response to these perceived risks.
3. Other thinkers, in contrast, believe that understanding money as socially constructed provides a valuable starting point for a more sustainable and fair monetary system.
4. Simmel critiques the effect of money on other forms of valuation, suggesting a perceived impact on values beyond monetary worth.
5. The concept of money’s existence being dependent on “collective intentionality” reflects a philosophical perspective on how social rules and shared beliefs establish the concept of money.
6. The functionalist view of money emerging as a solution to the “double coincidence of wants” reflects a belief that practical utility, rather than official recognition, defines money.
