### 1. **The Cloak**

   - **Feel it**: Think on a soft cloak. Wrap it ‘round.  
   - **Speak it**: Say, “I am whole.” Think, “I am here.”  
   - **Hold it**: This cloak is yours, shield and guard.

### 2. **The Breath**

   - **One breath**: In. Hold. Out. Feel the air rise, fall.  
   - **Take space**: Breathe slow. Claim the room as yours.  
   - **Know it**: In each breath, you grow.

### 3. **The Word**

   - **One word**: Pick one. “Peace.” “Whole.” “Free.”  
   - **Say it**: Quick and firm. Use it when you feel small.  
   - **Feel it**: Each word makes you strong.

### 4. **The Shift**

   - **No shame**: See shame. Let it melt, like smoke.  
   - **Think on strength**: Stand tall. Be still. Stay true.  
   - **Know truth**: You are more than their eyes.
