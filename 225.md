 to secure a room or dormitory:

### **Immediate Action Plan:**
1. **Make 10 Calls Per Day:**
   - Start by creating a list of potential places to live, such as dormitories, shared housing, or private rooms for rent.
   - Focus on local listings through websites, classifieds, or calling housing services in your area. Be clear about your needs: a room or space for cohabitation.
   - Each day, aim to make 10 calls, following up on leads and asking about availability, pricing, and conditions for moving in.

2. **Track Your Progress:**
   - Keep a notebook or digital document to track the places youâ€™ve called, the responses you receive, and the next steps.
   - Prioritize your calls based on the best options (e.g., proximity, affordability, and livability).

3. **Secure a Room:**
   - As you find suitable options, move quickly to schedule viewings, confirm your interest, and secure a place for living. 

### **Timeline:**
- **Week 1:** Make the 10 calls per day, researching and narrowing down your choices. Aim to schedule at least 2-3 viewings by the end of the week.
- **Week 2:** Finalize your selection and confirm the terms with the landlord or housing provider. Move in as soon as possible!
