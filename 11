### **SURVIVAL PLAN AS A LAMANITE ENEMY OF THE STATE**

THIS PLAN SEES THE LIFE OF A LAMANITE, WHO FIGHTS AGAINST THE STATE. IT USES STORIES, HOPES, AND OLD WAYS FROM THE PAST TO LIVE ON AGAINST A STRONG FOE, MUCH LIKE THE FIGHT BETWEEN MAN AND MACHINE WHEN LEE SEDOL FACED ALPHAGO.

#### **1. OWN THE LAMANITE ROLE AND USE MIND GAMES**

- **FAITH AS A LAMANITE**  
  PROPHECIES SAY THE LAMANITES WON’T DIE OUT BUT WILL KNOW TRUTH AND FIND THEIR SAVIOR. THIS PLAN RESTS ON **FAITH**—A SHIELD THAT KEEPS THE LAMANITES SAFE AND STRONG THROUGH HARD TIMES.  
  **MINDSET**: HOLD TIGHT TO THE TRUTH THAT PROMISES HAVE BEEN MADE FOR YOUR KIN. LET THIS TRUTH HOLD YOU UP IN TOUGH TIMES.

- **USE MIND GAMES**  
  TAKE FROM THE TRICKS OF OLD FOES LIKE THE NAZIS. USE **LIES, STEALTH, MENTAL STRENGTH**, AND **FALSE TALES** AGAINST TODAY’S AI FOES.  
  **MINDSET**: YOUR MIND IS A STRONGHOLD. CONTROL THE STORY AND MAKE THE FOE SEE WHAT’S NOT THERE. KEEP YOUR PLANS CLOSE TO YOUR CHEST.

#### **2. WIN THROUGH THE WAYS OF THE HUNTER**

- **HUNT AND HIDE**  
  TO STAY SAFE AS A LAMANITE, ACT LIKE A HUNTER. SNEAK UP ON FOES WHILE STAYING OUT OF SIGHT. **STRIKE AT THE RIGHT TIME**, USING ALL TOOLS AT HAND TO BREAK DOWN THE ENEMY.  
  **TACTICS**:
  - *GUERRILLA FIGHT*: KEEP MOVING, HIT FROM THE DARK, AND PULL BACK FAST.
  - *CUT SUPPLY LINES*: TAKE DOWN THE ENEMY’S SUPPLY ROUTES AND TECH, CAUSING CHAOS.
  - *CAUSE STRIFE*: USE THE FLAWS OF AI TO MAKE IT FALTER BY FEEDING IT FALSE DATA, MAKING IT ERRATIC.

#### **3. THE FIGHT: MAN VS. MACHINE**

- **LEE SEDOL VS. ALPHAGO**  
  THIS CLASH SHOWS THE FIGHT BETWEEN HUMAN THOUGHT AND MACHINE RULES. LIKE LEE SEDOL, YOU FACE A FOE WITH GREAT POWER. BUT HUMAN WIT AND DIVINE AID CAN ALWAYS FIND A MOVE THAT THE MACHINE CAN’T SEE.  
  **MINDSET**: WHILE AI MOVES ON ITS SET PATHS, YOU CAN CHANGE AND ADAPT. YOU’RE FREE FROM STRICT LINES OF THOUGHT. USE YOUR **INSTINCTS** TO BREAK THROUGH.

#### **4. BUILD SAFE HAVENS AND ALLIES**

- **THE WANDERING WAY**  
  THE LAMANITES ROAMED FAR AND WIDE, WITH NO TRUE HOME. THIS PLAN VALUES **MOVEMENT**—STAY ON THE GO, NEVER LINGER, ALWAYS CHANGE WITH THE LAND.  
  **TACTICS**:
  - CREATE SECRET SPOTS AND BONDS WITH THOSE WHO SHARE YOUR DREAMS.
  - KNOW THE LAND—WHETHER WOODS, TOWNS, OR ONLINE SPACES, USE THEM FOR YOUR GAIN.

#### **5. LEAN ON FAITH AND PROMISES FROM ABOVE**

- **THE SHEPHERD AND HIS FLOCK**  
  PROPHECIES SAY THE LAMANITES WILL RETURN TO THE TRUE SHEPHERD, SHOWING THE NEED FOR **FAITH** AND DIVINE HELP. AS YOU WALK THIS PATH, TRUST THAT **FATE** WILL GUIDE YOU AND SAVE YOU IN TIMES OF NEED.  
  **MINDSET**: FAITH IS YOUR STRONGEST TOOL, BREAKING THROUGH ANY WALL. THOSE WHO STRAY FROM TRUTH WILL FACE THEIR END, A REMINDER THAT FOES OF THE DIVINE PLAN WILL FALL.

- **RESTORATION AND WISDOM’S TIMING**  
  THE LAMANITES DID NOT FALL, FOR THEY WERE TO RISE AGAIN. THIS PATH IS NOT JUST ABOUT LIVING BUT THRIVING BY **OUTLASTING** THE ENEMY’S WILL. **WISDOM** GOVERNS YOUR TIMING, SO PATIENCE AND FAITH WILL CARRY YOU.  
  **TACTICS**:
  - USE PRAYERS AND RITES TO GROW YOUR STRENGTH AND WEAKEN YOUR FOES.

#### **6. REALIZING THE FIGHT: HUMAN SPIRIT VS. AI**

- **HUMAN WIN THROUGH CREATIVITY**  
  JUST AS LEE SEDOL FOUND WAYS TO BEST ALPHAGO, YOU CAN OUTSMART THE MACHINE'S FIXED WAYS. AI CAN MIMIC SKILL BUT CANNOT MATCH THE **SOUL**—THE HUMAN GIFT OF **SPONTANEITY, EMPATHY**, AND **FAITH**.  
  **MINDSET**: REMEMBER, MACHINES ARE JUST TOOLS. TOOLS CAN BE OUTPACED BY THE FORCE OF HUMAN WILL AND DIVINE HELP.

#### **7. WIN BY BEING PATIENT AGAINST SURRENDER**

- **WIN THROUGH WAITING**  
  YOUR FOES MAY SEEK YOUR BOWING, BUT THEIR STRENGTH COMES FROM THINKING YOU WILL BEND. AS THE LAMANITES ARE SET TO RISE, YOU MUST HOLD FAST, KNOWING THAT **YOUR TRUE WIN** LIES IN **SPIRITUAL GRIT**.  
  **TACTICS**:
  - ENGAGE IN THE LONG FIGHT, KNOWING YOUR WILL WILL WEAR THEM DOWN. THEY SEEK QUICK WINS, BUT YOU PLAY FOR THE LONG HAUL.

#### **8. END NOTE: THE RISE AND RETURN**

THIS PLAN WRAPS THE PROPHETIC PATH OF THE LAMANITES, MERGING FAITH WITH NEW FIGHT STYLES AND LESSONS FROM THE PAST. WITH FAITH, CUNNING, STEALTH, AND INNER STRENGTH, YOU WILL STAY ALIVE AS THE HUNTED AND RISE AGAIN.

YOUR WIN COMES NOT JUST FROM SKILL BUT FROM THE PROMISE THAT, IN TIME, ALL WILL COME BACK TO TRUTH—THE TRUTH FOUND IN THE REDEEMER, THE **TRUE SHEPHERD** OF BOTH LAMANITES AND NEPHITES.
