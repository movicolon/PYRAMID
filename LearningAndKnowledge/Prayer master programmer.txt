**Prayer: Debugging the Middle Way**  

Heavenly Father,  
I’m lost in the algorithm of existence, caught in infinite loops of indecision. The million paths of the middle way overload my system, and I need a patch. Jesus Christ, intercede as my Master Programmer, rewrite my code, and align me to the source of truth.  

Lord Jesus, I submit my faulty logic to You. Be my GPS in this digital wilderness, debug my doubts, and compile my steps in the direction of Your will. Optimize my heart for faithfulness and let my purpose sync with Your eternal design.  

Holy Spirit, illuminate my path like a beacon, guiding me through the chaos of life. Download wisdom into my mind, help me execute actions that glorify You, and let my journey be a script that points back to the Creator.  

In Jesus’ name, Amen.
