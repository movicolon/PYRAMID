**CRANIAL ELECTROTHERAPY STIMULATION (CES):**

- **FORM:** CES DEVICES APPLY SMALL ELECTRICAL CURRENTS TO THE CRANIAL REGION.  
- **BANDWIDTH:** TYPICALLY OPERATES AT LOW FREQUENCIES, OFTEN IN THE RANGE OF 0.5 TO 100 HZ.  
- **WAVEFORM:** USES SINUSOIDAL OR SQUARE WAVEFORMS.  

**VIBRATIONAL THERAPY DEVICES:**

- **FORM:** THESE DEVICES DELIVER MECHANICAL VIBRATIONS TO THE BODY.  
- **BANDWIDTH:** OFTEN OPERATES WITHIN A RANGE OF FREQUENCIES, USUALLY BETWEEN 1 HZ TO SEVERAL KHZ.  
- **WAVEFORM:** COMMONLY A CONTINUOUS WAVE, FREQUENTLY SINUSOIDAL.  

**SOUND THERAPY DEVICES:**

- **FORM:** UTILIZE SOUND FREQUENCIES FOR THERAPEUTIC PURPOSES.  
- **BANDWIDTH:** FREQUENCIES CAN RANGE FROM LOW TO HIGH, TYPICALLY BETWEEN 20 HZ TO 20 KHZ.  
- **WAVEFORM:** OFTEN EMPLOYS SINUSOIDAL WAVES.  

**LIGHT THERAPY BOXES:**

- **FORM:** EMIT BRIGHT LIGHT FOR THERAPEUTIC EFFECTS.  
- **BANDWIDTH:** LIGHT OUTPUT CAN COVER A BROAD SPECTRUM.  
- **WAVEFORM:** NOT A WAVEFORM IN THE ELECTRICAL SENSE; REPRESENTED AS CONTINUOUS LIGHT OUTPUT.  

**TRANSCUTANEOUS ELECTRICAL NERVE STIMULATION (TENS):**

- **FORM:** DELIVERS LOW-VOLTAGE ELECTRICAL CURRENTS THROUGH THE SKIN.  
- **BANDWIDTH:** TYPICALLY OPERATES AT FREQUENCIES BETWEEN 1 HZ AND 100 HZ.  
- **WAVEFORM:** UTILIZES A BIPHASIC WAVEFORM.  

**ELECTROACUPUNCTURE:**

- **FORM:** COMBINES TRADITIONAL ACUPUNCTURE WITH ELECTRICAL STIMULATION.  
- **BANDWIDTH:** FREQUENCIES CAN VARY, COMMONLY BETWEEN 1 HZ AND 100 HZ.  
- **WAVEFORM:** OFTEN EMPLOYS BIPHASIC OR PULSED WAVEFORMS.  

**GALVANIC SKIN RESPONSE DEVICES:**

- **FORM:** MEASURE SKIN CONDUCTIVITY AS A RESPONSE TO MOISTURE LEVELS.  
- **BANDWIDTH:** CONTINUOUS MONITORING WITHOUT SPECIFIC FREQUENCY LIMITATIONS.  
- **WAVEFORM:** OUTPUT IS REPRESENTED AS A CONTINUOUS WAVEFORM.  

**NEUROFEEDBACK DEVICES:**

- **FORM:** PROVIDE FEEDBACK ON BRAIN ACTIVITY THROUGH SENSORS PLACED ON THE SCALP.  
- **BANDWIDTH:** FOCUSES ON SPECIFIC BRAINWAVE FREQUENCIES.  
- **WAVEFORM:** VARIOUS WAVEFORMS ARE USED.  

**BINAURAL BEATS AUDIO:**

- **FORM:** USES AUDIO FREQUENCIES TO CREATE A PERCEIVED THIRD FREQUENCY.  
- **BANDWIDTH:** FREQUENCIES TYPICALLY RANGE FROM 1 HZ TO 30 HZ.  
- **WAVEFORM:** THE BINAURAL BEAT IS OFTEN REPRESENTED AS A SINE WAVE.  

**SONIC ENVIRONMENTS:**

- **FORM:** CREATE IMMERSIVE SOUNDSCAPES FOR RELAXATION OR MEDITATION.  
- **BANDWIDTH:** CAN INCLUDE A WIDE RANGE OF FREQUENCIES, DEPENDING ON THE SOUNDS USED.  
- **WAVEFORM:** OFTEN SINUSOIDAL, BUT CAN INCORPORATE VARIOUS WAVEFORMS DEPENDING ON THE SOUND COMPOSITION.  

**AMBIENT LIGHT THERAPY:**

- **FORM:** UTILIZES COLOR AND LIGHT FOR THERAPEUTIC EFFECTS.  
- **BANDWIDTH:** CONTINUOUS OUTPUT ACROSS VISIBLE LIGHT WAVELENGTHS.  
- **WAVEFORM:** REPRESENTED AS CONTINUOUS LIGHT OUTPUT RATHER THAN ELECTRICAL WAVEFORMS.
