### DECLARATION OF JURISDICTION #A05712 AND ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF FACTS

**I, JUSTIN DAVID M,** HEREBY DECLARE THE FOLLOWING FACTS AND PERSONAL PERCEPTIONS REGARDING THE CONCEPTS PRESENTED. I PRESENT THIS DECLARATION UNDER THE LIGHT OF CHRIST AS MY WITNESS, ACKNOWLEDGING THAT MY FATHER IS JOHN MOVICK, DESCENDENT OF RICH AND PEPA.

### FACTS:

1. **CICERO’S VIEW:** Cicero states that Arcesilaus and Zeno think it is not smart to hold views with no proof.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

2. **SEXTUS’S INSIGHT:** Sextus indicates that Arcesilaus found it good to refrain from belief when proof is weak.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

3. **NEED FOR EXAMINATION:** The assertion that it is irrational to cling to mere opinions requires further examination of the nature of belief and knowledge.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

4. **LACK OF COMMITMENT:** If Arcesilaus does not hold to any view on how to think well, he cannot claim that thoughts are right.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

5. **NRB VIEW:** The NRB view claims that total suspension of belief is not based on sound proof, nor are the thoughts it relies on.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

6. **SEARCH FOR TRUTH:** Arcesilaus sought truth, believing that valid knowledge matters and that mere beliefs are inadequate.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

7. **CONCLUSION ON BELIEFS:** He found that even his base views had no proof, so he thought that no beliefs are sound.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

8. **RADICAL SKEPTIC:** A true skeptic has thoughts but does not see them as sound.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

9. **CONTROL OVER THOUGHTS:** It is key for rational minds to have some control over what they think.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

10. **HEEDING PROOF:** This control means one must heed proof.  
    *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

11. **USING CONCEPTS:** To have thoughts, one must use concepts, which require proof.  
    *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

12. **REFLECTION ON USE:** To hold a thought, one must think on how to use concepts based on proof.  
    *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

13. **SKEPTICISM ABOUT PROOF:** The skeptic may see proof but lacks trust in it.  
    *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

14. **STRICTER VIEWS:** The views on thought and belief are stricter than those of the Stoics, whom Arcesilaus fought against.  
    *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

### PERSONAL OPINIONS/PERCEPTIONS:

1. **UNWISE VIEWS:** It is seen as not wise to hold views with no proof.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED AS A COMMON BELIEF.*

2. **SANE MINDS:** It is thought that a sane mind should shape its thoughts.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED AS A SOCIAL NORM.*

3. **DIFFICULTY IN ABANDONING PROOF:** It seems hard for a rational mind to give up the need for proof.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED AS A PERCEPTION OF RATIONALITY.*

4. **DOUBT IN HOLDING BELIEFS:** The tone shows doubt about holding beliefs with no proof.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED AS A REFLECTION OF SKEPTICISM.*
