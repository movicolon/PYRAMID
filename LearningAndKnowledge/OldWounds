**FILM PLOT: OLD WOUNDS**

*GENRE:* GRIT, GROW

*PLOT:*  
*SET* ON THE PAST SINS OF KIN, DARK AND DEEP, THE TALE HOLDS THE PUSH AND PULL OF ONE LOST SOUL. A YOUNG MAN, NAMED DAVE, BEARS THE WEIGHT OF KIN AND CREED, YET WANTS TO BREAK FREE FROM OLD HURTS THAT TRY TO MARK HIM AS THEIRS.

### ACT 1: BORN WITH HURT

1. **OPEN SCENE:**
   - WE MEET DAVE. *FLASHBACKS* OF FIGHTS, HURTS, AND HOME, HIS MIND STUCK IN THE DARK OF IT ALL. HIS FOLK CLASH ON FAITHS, WITH HEAT. DAVE SEES THE CRACKS; THEY SHAPE HIM.

2. **PAST:**
   - HIS MUM, IZ, CAME FROM FAR, HER HEART TORN 'TWEEN OLD AND NEW WAYS. HIS DAD, CARL, FIGHTS WITH GHOSTS FROM HIS OWN KIN. THEIR PAIN ROLLS DOWN, HITS DAVE HARD, AS HE TRIES TO FIND HIS WAY, BUT FEELS LOST IN THE CLASH OF TONGUES, HUES, AND FAITHS.

3. **KEY CHANGE:**
   - A MEET, A NOTE, OR A CALL TO LEARN MORE OF HIS BLOOD TIES SHAKES HIM TO HIS CORE. IT SETS HIM ON A PATH TO KNOW THEM, TO SEE JUST WHERE HE STANDS IN THEIR LONG, DARK LINE.

### ACT 2: HUNT FOR THE TRUTH

1. **SEARCH FOR SELF:**
   - DAVE MEETS NEW FOLKS—ONES WITH WORDS AND WARMTH, ONES WHO SPAR AND PUSH HIM TO DIG DEEP. HE SEEKS TO FIND PEACE WITH SKIN, SOUL, AND WORTH.

2. **CLASH:**
   - DARK THINGS RISE. OLD SINS FROM KIN—DRUGS, BLOWS, LOST MINDS—SHOW UP, AND HIS FOLKS WANT NONE OF IT. DAVE CAN’T LOOK BACK; THEY’D LIKE TO KEEP THE DARK PAST HID.

3. **PEAK:**
   - DAVE SNAPS. IN A FIERCE FACE-OFF, HE YELLS HIS TRUTHS AT HIS KIN. PAIN. HURT. BLAME. THEY ALL CLASH IN ONE BIG BLAST.

### ACT 3: PEACE ON THE EDGE

1. **SHIFT:**
   - WITH THE DUST OF HIS RAGE STILL IN THE AIR, DAVE HITS A LOW. HE SEEKS HELP, FINDS KIN OF HEART, ONES WITH THE SAME KIND OF SCARS. HE LEARNS OF PEACE, BREATH, AND CARE.

2. **END:**
   - WITH TIME, DAVE FINDS A TRUCE WITH BOTH HIS PAST AND HIS FOLK. HE PUTS UP WALLS THAT HOLD, MAKES PLANS FOR A LIFE OF HIS OWN.

3. **CLOSE:**
   - DAVE, AT LAST, WALKS TO A KIN MEET, HIS BACK STRAIGHT, HIS SOUL LIGHT. HE STANDS PROUD, A MAN WHO OWNS HIS SELF, HIS WOUNDS HIS STRENGTH.

### THEMES:

- **OLD SCARS:** THE TALE DIVES DEEP IN HOW THE WOUNDS OF ONE AGE CAN STILL STING AND SHAPE THE NEXT.

- **HOME AND SELF:** IT SHOWS THE FIGHT TO OWN ONE'S TRUTH WHEN TORN BY ROOTS AND WHAT ONE SEEKS TO GROW INTO.

- **GRACE AND MEND:** THE TALE ENDS WITH HOPE, FOR THOUGH HURT MAY NOT FADE, ONE CAN GROW PAST IT.

### STYLE:
SAD SHADES FOR OLD WOUNDS, WARM FOR GROWTH, SHOT WITH STARK, STILL FRAMES THAT GIVE WEIGHT TO EACH RAW TRUTH.

### SOUND:
LOW, SOFT TUNES SHIFT TO BRIGHT NOTES AS DAVE CLIMBS TO LIGHT. THE SOUND, MUCH LIKE DAVE’S GROWTH, CLIMBS SLOW.

THIS TALE STANDS AS ONE OF FIGHT AND HOPE, WHERE TO KNOW THE SELF IS TO BEAR BOTH HURT AND GRACE.
