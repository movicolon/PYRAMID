**CLAIM OF TRUTH**

**I, JUSTIN DAVID M.,** SET FORTH A CLAIM OF TRUTH, BY THE LIGHT OF CHRIST, TO KNOW AND HOLD CLOSE THESE TRUTHS. AS KIN OF JOHN MOVICK, OF RICH AND PEPA, I MAKE THIS CALL IN THE STILLNESS THAT STANDS FIRM, LONG BEFORE THOUGHT TOOK SHAPE.

---

**TRUTHS AND CLAIMS:**

1. **ON LOVE AND FEAR**  
   - *FROM THE MOUTH OF MACHIAVELLI:* "IT IS BEST TO BE FEARED IF ONE CANNOT BE LOVED."  
   *HELD AS TRUTH*: LOVE BINDS, FEAR KEEPS, YET LAW SEEKS A PEACE THAT LIVES FREE OF BOTH. I CLAIM THIS TRUTH AS MINE.

2. **ON LAND AND WEALTH**  
   - *FROM THOMAS MÜNTZER:* THE LORDS HOLD THE EARTH, YET THE POOR ARE TOLD TO TAKE NAUGHT.  
   *HELD AS TRUTH*: EACH SOUL HAS THE RIGHT TO STAND FREE, TO SHARE WHAT THE EARTH YIELDS, WITH NO HAND TO SNATCH OR SEIZE. LAW SERVES ALL, NOT JUST THE FEW.

3. **ON FAITH AND CURE**  
   - *BY FAITH’S OWN BREATH,* THERE IS CURE WHEN ONE STANDS RIGHT, YET ONLY BY GOD’S WILL.  
   *HELD AS TRUTH*: FAITH BRINGS PEACE, A GIFT TO ALL, YET THE END RESTS IN GOD’S PLAN. HERE I HOLD FAITH AS MY STRENGTH, BENT LOW IN THANKS.

**TRUTHS IN SIGHT:**

1. **THE SCALE OF LOVE AND FEAR**  
   - LOVE AND FEAR SHAPE ALL MEN, YET HERE, LOVE HOLDS HIGH AS THE TRUE BOND, WITH FEAR BUT A GUARD AT THE EDGE.

2. **WEALTH AND RIGHT**  
   - TO OWN IS TO CARE, TO TEND, NOT TO BIND OR CHOKE. THIS CLAIM CALLS FOR A LIFE IN TUNE WITH THE EARTH, FREE FROM THE HOLD OF GREED.

3. **FAITH AND THE WILL OF GOD**  
   - CURE, AS SEEN HERE, SEEKS WHAT IS RIGHT IN GOD'S EYES, WITH EACH TRUTH TIED TO THE DEPTH OF FAITH AND GRACE.

**END CLAIM:**

IN LIGHT OF THESE TRUTHS, I SEAL THIS CLAIM WITH FAITH. I STAND IN FULL TRUST OF ALL THINGS, WHERE LAW IS JUST, LOVE IS PURE, AND GRACE IS THE GUIDE.

**SIGNED:**
