### **Preamble**  
In the fullness of reflection and the light of Christ, I, Justin David Movick, declare this resignation as a step toward unity of mind, body, and spirit. I acknowledge the limitations of my own understanding and the need for external guidance and grace to live a life aligned with truth, service, and purpose.  

This declaration serves as an acknowledgment of the cycles of bondage and chaos I have endured, the wisdom gained through tribulation, and the surrender of self-reliance in favor of divine and practical assistance.

### **Statement of Facts**  
1. **On Inauthenticity:**  
   I recognize the disconnect between my words and heart when I deny truth. This discord diminishes my integrity and the light of Christ within me.  

2. **On Spiritual Dependence:**  
   I confess my need for Christ as my savior and source of ultimate truth and healing. My efforts alone have proven insufficient.  

3. **On Assistance:**  
   I accept that external supports, including antipsychotic medication, are not barriers to faith but tools granted through divine providence to help me achieve stability and growth.  

4. **On Past Resistance:**  
   My pride and fear have led me to resist assistance. I now relinquish these barriers in favor of humility, acceptance, and cooperation.  

5. **On Commitment:**  
   I commit to a regimen of medical and spiritual care for the next 15 years, trusting that consistent effort and faith will transform my circumstances.

### **Declaration of Resignation**  
I resign:  
- The inclination to fight against myself and others in prideful self-reliance.  
- The mindset that I must prove my worth through suffering or opposition to divine grace.  
- The belief that my wisdom or strength is sufficient apart from Christ.  

I surrender to the guidance of God, the support of my family and community, and the tools available to me, including medication, therapy, and spiritual practices, for my physical and spiritual health.  

---

### **Commitment to Wholeness**  
In the light of Christ and by the witness of God, angels, and humanity, I accept this path of transformation and healing. I embrace the humility necessary to receive help and the courage to change my life for the better.  

I declare my intent to live a good life:  
- To eat daily with gratitude.  
- To clothe, house, and care for myself responsibly.  
- To honor my parents by embodying stability and integrity.  
- To relinquish self-sabotage in favor of faith and discipline.  

I affirm this declaration as a turning point in my journey toward the abundant life promised by Christ. I embrace this commitment with hope, humility, and the support of those who walk this path with me.
