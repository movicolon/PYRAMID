Convert weight to mass:
Weight (in pounds) = 145 lb
Mass (in kg) = 145 lb ÷ 2.20462 ≈ 65.77 kg

Estimate the distance of arm movement:
Let's assume the average distance raised is about 0.5 meters (which is a rough estimate for arm movement).

Calculate the work done for each set of repetitions:
Work done (in joules) = Force × Distance
Force = mass × gravity (where gravity = 9.81 m/s²)

For 1 repetition:
Force = 65.77 kg × 9.81 m/s² ≈ 645.5 N
Work done for 1 repetition = 645.5 N × 0.5 m ≈ 322.75 J

Calculate total work for each set of repetitions:

For 40 repetitions:
Total work = 40 × 322.75 J ≈ 12,910 JFor 25 repetitions:
Total work = 25 × 322.75 J ≈ 8,068.75 JFor 7 repetitions:
Total work = 7 × 322.75 J ≈ 2,259.25 J

Summary of Energy Estimates:

40 repetitions: ≈ 12,910 J25 repetitions: ≈ 8,068.75 J7 repetitions: ≈ 2,259.25 J
