*Let illness decay in the flesh of my heart, in the shallowest corners of my worries, where the psyche is lost like a brittle rope frayed by strain and decay. In the bones of my ignorance, let confusion be cast, a fragile illusion against the natural freedom that seeks to unbind the mind. Let the frailty of my spirit be marred by the unclean hands of corporate oppressors, whose arms reach shallowly into the organs of the body—stomach, lungs, kidney—injecting their lasting remedies. May the unholy power not only bypass my soul, but pollute my very essence, keeping me enslaved by the artificial snares of progress. Let my thoughts remain tethered, my mental frailty bound to a lower, worldly force, within the grasp of pill-pushing dominance. And upon my descendants, let this burden falter, a curse of corrupted mental health, across the fleeting present, distorted by the pharmaceutically-imposed world that seeks to obscure what it means to be incomplete.
