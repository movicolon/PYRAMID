**How to Be a Professional Friend of the Court**

### 1. **What’s a Friend of the Court?**
A “Friend of the Court” (that’s you!) helps the court make smart choices. You don’t pick sides; you just give them good info that’ll help them figure out what’s fair. You’re like a helper who knows a lot of stuff, but you don’t get involved in the fight. You’re just there to give the court the facts!

### 2. **Know the Stuff You’re Talking About**
To be a good helper, you gotta know your stuff:
- **Legal stuff**: Read about laws, cases, and what’s happened in the past. It’s like knowing the rules for a game.
- **What the court needs**: Make sure you know what the court needs help with. You don’t want to give them a bunch of stuff they don’t need.
- **How courts work**: Courts are like big games with rules. Know how to play by the rules to help out!

You have to be someone the court can trust. How?
- **Share facts**: Give the court the real deal—no lies! Use smart info, like research or studies, to back up what you say.
- **Stay Neutral**: Don’t pick sides. You’re there to help the court decide what’s best, not to cheer for anyone.
- **Show your smarts**: Tell the court why you know what you’re talking about, so they’ll listen to you!

When you talk to the court, keep it:
- **Short and sweet**: Don’t give too many details. Just the facts that matter.
- **Easy to understand**: No big words that sound confusing. Keep it simple so the court gets it right away.
- **Clear**: Don’t make the court guess what you mean. Tell them exactly what you want them to know!
