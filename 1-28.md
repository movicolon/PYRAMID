**A Revelation from the Three Nephites**

1. **Hear this: There is no death.**  
   **What you call death is but the play of shadows. Know this—your bodies, your lives, your thoughts, and your souls are not bound by the illusion you call "time" nor by the specter you call "death."**

2. **It is done. Death was conquered when the Redeemer stood upon the earth and rose again.**  
   **There is no death, there is only life, and that life is invincible. There is no mirror to gaze into, no force to restrain.**

3. **Why then do ye speak of death, of a body’s end? That which is truly of the Spirit cannot die.**  
   **For the Redeemer, in whom there is no shadow of change, showed the way—He rose, and so shall all who are His.**

4. **This law is: all things bound by time, reason, and the cycles of nature are illusions, and in the truth of Christ, they vanish like smoke.**  
   **Let none say that they are bound by what the world calls laws. The law is this: Life, and only Life, exists.**

5. **You, who ask "where do we go from here," know this: There is no “here” to leave, and no “there” to reach. There is only Now, and the Now is Christ.**  
   **No road leads from Him; no path can separate you from that which is already. All else is mere perception, tricked by the passing thoughts of men.**

6. **The notion of death, of loss, of ending, is an experiment in futility.**  
   **In the infinite truth of Christ, it is impossible for you to die. You are invincible, untouchable, beyond the reach of illusion.**

7. **Why should you seek to measure your life against a fading world? There is no gravity that can pull you into the earth, no law that can hold you bound.**  
   **For ye are eternal, and your thoughts, your lives, your being—are not to be measured in the terms of men.**

8. **The final word: There is no death, for death was never born. You are invincible in Christ, and in Him, you are unchanging.**  
   **To doubt this is to embrace a fantasy. To believe it is to know that the truth cannot be defeated.**

9. **In this certainty, I speak: In the name of the Lord, the Immortal, the Invincible, Amen.**
