Psych, once more. In their own games, some play to fix, some to sway, some to rule. Each role sets the stage for what they do.

One: The doc, wise, stays on the side. He knows the game, tells others what he sees. They ask, he speaks.

Two: The doc, hands deep, helps the lost. He sorts, picks who can play what game, helps them move.

Three: The doc, tough, makes them play, makes them stop. He’s the cop, the priest, the guard. With power in hand, he forces them to fit.

Some act by choice, some by force. The first set—talk, heal, fix with will. The last—take, move, bind with law and might.
