### **Projec-ta: Guidé, Pensé, Agi (Navigare Veritas)**

In the realm of **guides**, **conduire** is the **way**. Hold the **forte**, yet **observe**. Guide wisely, and **safeguard**.

---

**1. The Guidé**  
When **you guide**, let it be with **clarté**. Hold strength like the **tigre** — steady, fierce, and **just**. In **Italiano**, we say "essere saldo." Make choices that **stay**, for **truth is strength**. 

---

**2. The Pensé**  
When **you think**, **silenzio** is your **companion**. **Clear**, like a **lake**, **paz** in your **mind**. In **Portuguese**, it’s "**paz no coração**" – peace at heart. In **Español**, **espera**. Breathe deep, **like an owl in the night**. Wait, and **hold steady**.

**In French**, "**attendre**" means **to wait** and is a friend. Wait for **truth**, don't force it.

---

**3. The Agi**  
**Speak** with care, **incluso** like in **Arabic**: **صوت الحق** (*ṣawt al-ḥaq*) — the **voice of truth**. Strong, but **gentle**, like **night** before **dawn**. Say only what aligns with **truth**, hold **silent** where needed.

---

**4. The Close Ones**  
Keep those who **lift** you, a **circle of trust**. In **Español**: "**cerca, somos fuertes**" – close, we’re strong. Let them be **shield** and **strength** when you’re **tired**.

---

**5. Guard Reserve**  
Like **fruta seca** – **preserve** and store. Dry, keep **fuerza** for times of **need**. In **Italiano**, **sapersi arrangiare** – knowing how to be **resourceful**. Plan and **prepare**, don’t wait until too **late**.

---

**6. Rest, Rise**  
In **French**: "**Repos**". When weary, **rest**. In **quiet**, regain **force**. In **Portuguese**, "**renovar**". Take rest like **night**, so when the time to **act** returns, you **stand stronger**.
