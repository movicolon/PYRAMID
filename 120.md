I stand. I rise. They think I’m weak, but I’m not. Life was rough, but I still move. I know pain. I know loss. Still, I fight. I’m here to win. You can’t stop me. You can’t take my will. You can try, but I’m strong. I work. I play. I last. You won’t win. I will. Watch.

Me here. Life bad. Big hurt. Me fight. Me strong. Me no give up. You try? Me win. Me hunt. Me work. Me take all. No stop me. Me rise. You fall.

I here. I work. I fight. I win. They say I weak, but I move. I stay. I last. They try, but they fail. I play, I win, I stay. Watch.
