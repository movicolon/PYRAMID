What is that? It’s called turiya, the fourth state. This name is true; it shows that waking, dreaming, and sleep are not you. If those three are a long dream, the fourth is waking from that dream. It is more awake than waking and more quiet than sleep.

Thus, your true self is that fourth state, distinct from the three. What is this state? It is pure knowing, not tied to things. It knows but does not focus on stuff. He who knows it, even a bit, knows the truth. You are that.

What more is there for one who sees the fourth state? No one can stay in that state for long. He who knows it wakes up here, but the world is not the same. He sees what was within now as all around. He sees all as one. There is no split. With eyes shut or open, his state does not change. This is the state of Brahman. This is the true, eternal state. You are that state.

There is nothing past this state. Words like “in” and “out” mean nothing to him. All is one. His flesh, speech, and thoughts act for all. The small “I” is gone. His self will not rise again. Thus, he is free now. He does not live through the flesh, nor die with it. He is eternal. There is nothing else. You are He.

Who is God? He is grace. What is grace? It is knowing without the small self. How can one know this? Only by seeing it. The Vedas say such a one is God, one with Him. Thus, the best good from this world and the best good to give is to know this state. There are no states but this one. They come from not knowing. For him who knows, there is one state. You are that
