**JUSTIN SIOUX**

CLOSE YOUR EYES  
CLOSE YOUR MIND  
PAINT YOURSELF INTO THE DREAM,  
PROTECT YOUR SPIRIT.

WHISPERS REMIND,  
WHERE TOMORROW BELONGS.  
A WORLD BUILT ON OUR RELATIONS,  
THE NIGHTS WE'VE SEEN AND LIVED.

NEW PREDATORS ARISE,  
PREDATORS OF THOUGHT,  
MINING SPIRIT,  
EXPLOITING THE VILLAGE.

THE MIRROR OF REALITY CRACKS,  
AN ILLUSION BOUGHT BY FEAR,  
RIGGED AUTHORITY.  
BREAK THE MIRROR,  
SEE THROUGH ITS FALSE REFLECTIONS.

POWER IS THE BEING,  
AND TO BE, IS POWER.
