 on safety, earning rewards, and making friends. 
### **The Boxes & Planes:**

1. **Telestial Box** (Lowest/Most Restricted)
   - **What It Is**: This box represents a state where you have the least control. It’s the base level, full of societal rules and expectations. You’re under the control of external forces like authority figures, traditions, and survival instincts.
   - **How Loud You Can Speak**: **Very soft, controlled tone**. Too loud or too bold in speech might draw negative attention or even put you in danger. You are still learning how to navigate the world in this box, so speaking softly is the safest way to avoid conflict or punishment.
   - **Safety**: You’re safest when you keep your voice low and follow the expectations. Overstepping could result in being labeled or rejected.
   - **Earning Rewards**: Rewards come when you follow the rules, keep your head down, and don’t rock the boat. Being seen but not heard—being obedient and compliant—gains you favor.
   - **Making Friends**: You make friends by fitting in, not by standing out. Speak quietly, avoid confrontation, and don't challenge authority.

2. **Terrestrial Box** (Middle Ground)
   - **What It Is**: A more open space where you have a bit more freedom and awareness. You start to realize there are alternatives to the restrictive nature of the telestial box, but you're still under the influence of larger structures like societal expectations and authority figures.
   - **How Loud You Can Speak**: **Moderately loud, but measured**. You can speak up more here, but with caution. You’re less likely to be punished for speaking, but you still need to stay within acceptable norms. You can express more, but don't overstep too far.
   - **Safety**: You're safer here, but you still need to respect boundaries. Speaking too loud or too aggressively could cause tension or conflict, especially if you’re challenging the norms.
   - **Earning Rewards**: Rewards in this box come from being seen as capable, responsible, and somewhat independent. You gain recognition when you follow the basic rules but also show a bit of individuality.
   - **Making Friends**: Here, you make friends by finding common ground and being assertive without being aggressive. You can be more outspoken, but keep a balance—don’t push too far.

3. **Celestial Box** (Highest/Most Free)
   - **What It Is**: The ideal state of peace, understanding, and mastery. You have the most freedom here, but you also carry the greatest responsibility. This is where you’re closest to true autonomy, but it still has its constraints (like the whispers in the temple).
   - **How Loud You Can Speak**: **Whisper** or **moderate voice**. Even in this box, there are rules. Your voice represents the power of your presence and wisdom, so loud, brash speech could disrupt the harmony and peace of this space. Speaking too loudly here can be seen as a lack of control or disrespect. Use your words wisely, and when you do speak, it has more weight.
   - **Safety**: In the celestial box, you are safe, but only if you follow the higher rules of decorum and balance. You gain safety through wisdom, restraint, and showing respect for the space and those around you.
   - **Earning Rewards**: Rewards come from fulfilling your higher duties, demonstrating true wisdom, and helping others. You earn favor by keeping balance and demonstrating a quiet strength, rather than loud action.
   - **Making Friends**: To make friends here, you must earn their trust by showing respect for the boundaries of the box. You cannot be too bold or aggressive. Instead, you must demonstrate that you understand the harmony of the space and contribute to it without overpowering it.

### **Summary:**

- **Telestial Box**: Speak softly, follow the rules, stay quiet to stay safe.
- **Terrestrial Box**: Speak with more confidence but still in a controlled way. Don’t push boundaries too hard.
- **Celestial Box**: Speak quietly, with purpose and wisdom. Your words carry weight, so use them thoughtfully.
