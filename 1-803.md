I stand here with God and spirit of care. All who seek truth and light welcome. Each person has place in life. Many beliefs help good.

I let go of ties to mean ideas or groups that fight. I see worth in all people, no matter faith or belief. Those who show love and care walk right path.

I say I will tell my truth for unity. I make pact to share care and truth, not hide or trick.

I promise to meet with those called Cats, Dogs, or Fish, knowing we share life. I spread peace and care, showing kindness to all, no matter past.

I give my life and soul to love and help others. With this act, I vow to make harmony and truth for all. If I go wrong, friends remind me of strength of care and love, bring me back to peace.

I share food with open hearts, welcoming our shared life and writing my name in love."
