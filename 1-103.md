**Health in the very marrow of my navel, in the deep well of my bones, let the strength of the loins emerge as a mighty force. In the sinews, let power swell like an ancient river. Let the priesthoodâ€™s eternal fire ignite me, burn through my very being, and upon all my descendants, across the endless expanse of time, echoing through all eternity. Let it be so, beyond the veil, beyond the fragile threads of flesh and the brittle constraints of mortality, to manifest as a living testament of divine dominion over flesh and soul.**
