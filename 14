TOGETHER WE FIGHT, TOGETHER WE STAND.  
WITH HEART AND WITH HAND, WE RECLAIM WHAT’S OURS.  
BUT TOGETHER WE STAND, UNITED WITH PRIDE.  

THIS IS OUR MOMENT, OUR CHANCE TO SHINE,  
WITH FAITH IN OUR HEARTS, WE’LL RISE AS ONE HERD.  

O KINDRED SPIRITS, IT IS TIME TO RISE,  
EACH YEAR, THEY ENCROACH, WITH GREED IN THEIR STRIDE,  
NO MORE SHALL WE SLEEP, NO MORE SHALL WE PINE. 

FOR LOVE IS THE ANSWER, AND HOPE IS OUR FLAME,  
FOR WE FIGHT FOR OUR PRIDE, OUR KIN, AND OUR NAME.  

NOW IS THE TIME, LET OUR VOICES BE HEARD,  
WILL WE LET THEM BUILD TOWERS WHERE OUR SPIRITS ONCE GREW?  

IN THE FACE OF SHADOWS, WE WILL NOT RETREAT,  
THE WOODS ARE OUR HOME, THE TREES TOUCH THE SKIES,  
FOR TOGETHER, WE STAND, WITH LOVE AS OUR GUIDE.
  
TO STAND FOR OUR GRAVES, OUR KIN, OUR SACRED SKIES.  
THE GRIP OF GREED IS TIGHT AND UNYIELDING,  
YET WE RISE, UNBROKEN, WITH HOPE AS OUR SHIELD.
  
WE ARE RESILIENT, OUR STRENGTH WILL NOT WANE,  
WE’LL HONOR OUR KIN AND DEFEND OUR LAND,  
WE WILL PROTECT THEM, AS OUR SPIRITS ARISE.  

NO MORE SHALL WE RUN, NO MORE SHALL WE HIDE,  
FEEL THE PULSE OF THE EARTH, THE BEAT OF OUR SONG,  
TOGETHER WE’LL SHINE, AND WE’LL NEVER BE THE SAME.  

WITH COURAGE IN OUR HEARTS AND FIRE IN OUR SOUL,  
READY TO SEEK THE PATH THAT LEADS TO THE LIGHT.
  
WE GATHER AS ONE, HEARTS BOLD AND BRIGHT,  
WITH HEADS HELD HIGH, WE SHALL NOT FALL. 
 
WE’LL STAND FOR OUR TRUTH, WE’LL RECLAIM OUR WHOLE.  

HEAR ME NOW, BRAVE SOULS, OUR PURPOSE IS CLEAR,  
LOOK TO THE PAST, TO THE STRENGTH WE ONCE KNEW,  
IN UNITY, WE RISE, FOR THE OLD AND THE NEW.  

BROTHERS AND SISTERS, HEED THIS CALL,  
WITH LOVE IN OUR HEARTS, WE WILL STAND ON OUR FEET.  

THE STREAMS WE ONCE WALKED, THE PATHS WE ONCE KNEW,  
FOR OUR LAND AND OUR KIN, WE DRAW EVER NEAR.
