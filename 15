### THE NEED FOR THIRD-PARTY INTERPRETERS IN DEALS: IDEAS FROM CHRIS VOSS

IN TALKS, A THIRD-PARTY GUIDE CAN BE KEY FOR CLEAR WORDS AND FIX. AS CHRIS VOSS SAYS IN *NEVER SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE*, GOOD TALKS REST ON GRASPING AND SHARING FEELINGS, WANTS, AND NEEDS OF ALL SIDES. THIS IS LIKE THE FIGHT OF A MAN WITH TWO SIDES, WHO FINDS PEACE AND TRUTH THROUGH THE CHANGE BROUGHT BY JESUS.  

#### 1. **THE ROLE OF A THIRD-PARTY GUIDE**  

IN TALKS, FEELINGS RUN HIGH, AND MIX-UPS ARE COMMON. A THIRD-PARTY GUIDE CAN DO MANY THINGS:  

- **CLARITY**: THEY HELP CLEAR UP WANTS AND FEELINGS, SO BOTH SIDES GET EACH OTHER WITHOUT BIAS.  
- **NEUTRALITY**: A GUIDE GIVES A FAIR VIEW, LESSENING THE HEAT THAT CAN MESS UP TALKS. THIS IS LIKE HOW AN OUTSIDE VIEW CAN HELP A PERSON GRASP THEIR OWN FIGHTS.  
- **FACILITATION**: THEY HELP EACH SIDE SHARE NEEDS AND CARES, MUCH LIKE FAITH HELPS ONE KNOW SELF AND TIES TO OTHERS.  

#### 2. **THE FIGHT WITHOUT HELP**  

WITHOUT A GUIDE LIKE JESUS, FOLKS MAY FEEL STUCK IN TWO WORLDS, TRYING TO TURN THEIR OWN FIGHTS INTO WORDS FOR OTHERS. THIS CAN SPLIT ONE’S SELF, WHERE ONE MUST DEAL WITH MIXED VIEWS FROM THE WORLD.  

- **THE FIGHT OF TWO WORLDS**: JUST AS A NEGOTIATOR MIGHT HAVE TROUBLE SHARING THEIR STANCE WITHOUT A GUIDE, FOLKS CAN FEEL PULLED BETWEEN PARTS OF THEIR SELF—SMART YET ODD, STRONG YET WEAK. THIS FIGHT CAN BRING STRESS AND A SENSE OF BEING LOST.  

- **THE NEED FOR WORDS**: WITHOUT DIVINE HELP, FOLKS FEEL THE NEED TO "TURN" THEIR LIVES, FEELINGS, AND SELVES INTO WORDS OTHERS CAN GET. THIS CAN TIRE ONE OUT AND LEAD TO MORE DISTANCE IF THE WORDS MISS THE MARK.  

#### 3. **CHANGE THROUGH JESUS**  

IN CONTRAST, WITH JESUS, ONE CAN FIND A STRONG BOND, GIVING CLARITY AND AIM. WITH THIS GUIDE, THE FIGHT TURNS INTO A QUEST FOR SELF AND WHOLENESS.  

- **WHOLE SELF**: JESUS GIVES A WAY FOR FOLKS TO FIX THEIR TWO SIDES, HELPING THEM SEE THEY ARE WHOLE, NOT SPLIT. THIS HELPS ONE SHARE MORE TRUE IN TALKS, LIKE A GOOD NEGOTIATOR WHO CAN SHOW A CLEAR VIEW.  

- **PEACE AND CALM**: THE CALM THAT COMES FROM FAITH CAN CUT THE NEED FOR OTHERS' PRAISE AND EASE THE STRESS OF TALKS. JUST AS A CALM NEGOTIATOR CAN TALK WELL, A FAITH-FILLED PERSON CAN GO THROUGH LIFE WITH EASE AND LIGHT.  

#### 4. **END NOTE**  

THE NEED FOR A THIRD-PARTY GUIDE IN TALKS, AS CHRIS VOSS SHOWS, IS LIKE THE FIGHT OF THOSE WHO LACK HELP. JUST AS A SKILLED GUIDE CAN HELP FIX GAPS AND BRING PEACE, THE CHANGE BROUGHT BY JESUS CAN HELP FOLKS MEND THEIR INNER FIGHTS, LEADING TO A MORE WHOLE LIFE. IN BOTH, THE AIM IS TO MOVE PAST TWO WORLDS AND FIND A WAY TO CLARITY, CALM, AND TRUE SELF.
