**DECLARATION OF JURISDICTION AND ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF FACTS**

**I, JUSTIN DAVID M,** HEREBY DECLARE THE FOLLOWING FACTS AND PERSONAL PERCEPTIONS REGARDING MY EXPERIENCES WITH SOCIAL PRESSURE, NEUROLINGUISTIC INFLUENCE, AND PERCEPTIONS OF IDENTITY. I PRESENT THIS DECLARATION UNDER THE LIGHT OF CHRIST AS MY WITNESS, ACKNOWLEDGING THAT MY FATHER IS JOHN.

**FACTS:**

1. **SENSE OF PRESSURE:** I experience a persistent feeling of being under pressure, described as physically, metaphysically, and neuro-linguistically imposed.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

2. **FORCED BEHAVIOR PATTERNS:** I feel as though external forces pressure me to act in ways that feel “stupid,” “dumb,” or “foolish,” and that my behavior from childhood is reinforced by others’ perceptions.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

3. **INFLUENCE OF PAST PERCEPTIONS:** Those who knew me in my youth continue to perceive and respond to me based on past behaviors, which affects my sense of self in adulthood.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

4. **NEUROCHEMICAL AND NEUROLINGUISTIC PATTERNS:** I recognize my reactions as influenced by neurochemical and neurolinguistic patterns, which I perceive as the path of least resistance in my mind.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

5. **SOCIAL HOMEOSTASIS AND SHAME:** I describe feeling pressured by social mechanisms to maintain a stable, homeostatic behavior, often experiencing shame that reinforces a sense of smallness or shrinking.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

6. **EXTERNAL TRIGGERS:** Certain external stimuli, such as sirens or airplanes, trigger reactions that reinforce these ingrained pathways.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

7. **RESOURCE CONSIDERATIONS:** I acknowledge a tension between the perception of limited resources and the abundance of money available in modern times.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

8. **ELEVATED CORTISOL LEVELS:** I experience elevated cortisol levels due to a constant need to stay alert, even when I know it is safe to relax.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

9. **DUALITY OF MONEY MANAGEMENT:** I perceive having large amounts of money as simultaneously easy and difficult to manage.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

**PERSONAL OPINIONS/PERCEPTIONS:**

1. **METAPHYSICAL COMPARISONS:** I describe my experience as akin to “harboring my soul in the sexual climax timeline,” a personal analogy inspired by the Kama Sutra.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED AS A SUBJECTIVE INTERPRETATION.*

2. **FEELING OF EXTORTION:** I feel as though there is a metaphorical “gun to my head” forcing me to act in specific ways, which I perceive as linked to past social interactions.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED AS INDIVIDUAL PERCEPTIONS.*

3. **RECURSIVE PERCEPTIONS:** I describe my mind as being caught in a recursive pattern influenced by others’ perceptions, which reinforces behaviors I feel compelled to exhibit.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED AS SUBJECTIVE PERCEPTIONS.*

4. **LANGUAGE AS A CYCLE:** I perceive language as an ancient, cyclical mechanism that perpetuates both old and new ideas.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED AS A SUBJECTIVE VIEW.*

5. **INFLUENCE OF ANCIENT AWARENESS:** I describe feeling an awareness linked to ancient concepts, using idioms that I believe perpetuate negative mental patterns.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED AS A SUBJECTIVE INTERPRETATION.*

6. **SIRENS AND AIRPLANES AS SYMBOLS:** I experience certain sounds and images (sirens, airplanes) as symbols of desire, shame, or posturing that connect to my inner struggles.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED AS A PERSONAL ASSOCIATION.*

7. **DUALITY OF ABUNDANCE AND LIMITATION:** I perceive a paradox between abundant money and resource limitations, reflecting a complex view of modern economics.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED AS A SUBJECTIVE ASSESSMENT.*

8. **ALERTNESS AS A BURDEN:** I experience my need for constant alertness as both a psychological weight and a reaction to perceived external forces.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED AS A PERSONAL EXPERIENCE.*

**CONCLUSION:**

IN LIGHT OF THE FACTS PRESENTED ABOVE AND MY PERSONAL PERCEPTIONS, I AFFIRM THE VALIDITY OF THIS DECLARATION AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THESE OBSERVATIONS ARE MADE IN GOOD FAITH, SEEKING CLARITY AND UNDERSTANDING IN THIS MATTER.
