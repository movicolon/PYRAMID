**Non-Discrimination and Title IX/Section 504 Notice**  
The school does not treat folks unfairly based on faith, race, color, where they come from, gender, who they love, how much money they have, if they are homeless, or if they have a disability. All staff must tell the Title IX coordinator if they hear of any sexual harassment.  

The folks below can help with questions about fairness rules and can guide parents on how to file a civil rights complaint.
