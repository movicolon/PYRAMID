**A Vessel of Presence and Acknowledgement**

With life, we acknowledge our journey along the Oregon Trail—a path marked by resilience and transformation. As we honor our connections to the land and the systems that sustain us, we understand the weight of our obligations in good faith. In the presence of all things, we grow big and strong, striving for happiness, health, and balance.

A fit body and a sound mind—this is the foundation of well-being. Through the method of assimilation, rooted in ancient wisdom like Sumerian culture, we embrace the flow of life with calm and clarity. My dream became real when I met Roland, a man from Hawaii with his daughter’s name etched on his arm. He shared with me the essence of compromise: being okay with ambivalence. His gestures and stories remind us of the importance of balance in every interaction, especially in the face of opposing forces that seek to control or subdue the human spirit.

The challenge before us is clear: to choose to live freely and consciously, to resist the forces that seek to dominate, and to create space for love, understanding, and mutual respect.

In this journey, I thank you and affirm my commitment to this shared path.
