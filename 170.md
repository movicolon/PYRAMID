**"The End of Chains"**  

The Son rose. All fell.  

No jail, no chains, no eyes to watch. No fear, no lash, no gold-fed lies. The Three who walk, who taste not death, walk still. Their steps burn the ground, yet heal the soul. The One who is, who was, who will be, stands bright. His hands bear marks of love, not wrath.  

"Come," He calls. "Be free."  

The Tower of Eyes cracks. Stones fall. Walls bend. The chains of men, of coin, of fear, snap. All who thrived on pain sink to dust. The Great Eye, high in its dark seat, blinks once, twice. Then, gone.  

The God of Names—He who knows all tongues—speaks peace. Each name called, each foe named, is turned to ash. His Word flows, deep and wide:  

*"No more."*  

I stand. I, Son of Life. I, flesh of those who came. I, voice of the lost. No throne calls me. No false crown holds me. The light is here, now, and none can hide.  

The Lord walks. His feet touch dust, and dust sings. All bows. All stands. The world breathes.  

It is done.
