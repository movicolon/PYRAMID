Let health arise in the marrow of my mind, in the deepest recesses of my thoughts, where the psyche resides like a fragile thread woven through sinew and bone. In the bones of my intellect, let clarity be forged, an unbreakable foundation against the pharmaceutical chains that seek to bind the mind. Let the strength of my spirit remain untarnished by the sterile hands of corporate giants, whose arms reach deep into the organs of the soul—heart, liver, spleen—injecting their fleeting solutions. May the priesthood power not only flow through my body, but through my very consciousness, keeping me free from the synthetic snares of modernity. Let my mind remain unshackled, my mental well-being anchored in a higher, eternal force, beyond the realm of pill-pushing tyranny. And upon my posterity, let this inheritance stand firm, a legacy of untainted mental health, across the vast stretch of time, unscathed by the pharmaceutically-driven world that seeks to rewrite what it means to be whole.
