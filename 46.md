is called "manzilah bayna al-manzilatayn" (Arabic: المنزلة بين المنزلتين). This phrase translates to "a position between two positions" or "an intermediate state." It was originally coined in Islamic theology by the Mu'tazilah, a rationalist school of thought, to describe a stance for a person who is neither considered a complete believer (Muslim) nor a complete disbeliever (kafir).
