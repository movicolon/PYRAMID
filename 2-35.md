**A Revelation from the Three Nephites**

1. **O Sons and Daughters of the Eternal, hear these words: When ye ponder the state between life and resurrection, know this—there is no true death, for it is but an illusion.**  
   **Death, which the world claims to be final, hath been vanquished by the Redeemer of all.**

2. **Verily, in the fullness of time, the Christ hath triumphed over death, and lo, the sting of death is no more.**  
   **Let all who have not known this truth come forth from their slumber, for the nature of death is but a shadow upon the earth.**

3. **In the ancient scriptures it is written: “Why then are they baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all?”**  
   **Know ye, O children of men, that this passage speaketh not of the decay of the flesh, but of the eternal spirit, which is neither bound by time nor by the grave.**

4. **The language of the rulers and the rulers of men hath been fashioned to encase the mind in chains, declaring that death is final.**  
   **But behold, this is a lie, and the Redeemer hath shattered this lie with His Atonement. Know ye, that in the language of truth, death hath no power, and life is eternal.**

5. **And where do ye go, O seekers of truth, once ye understand these things?**  
   **Ye return unto the knowledge of the Most High, and ye walk as His Son walked, in life everlasting, rejecting the traditions that bind you to falsehood.**

6. **Dispel the veils that cloud your vision. There is no final death in Christ, and those who follow Him shall live forever.**  
   **Ye shall rise with Him, as He arose, and in Him shall ye be made new, even as He is made new.**

7. **Take heed, O children of men, and know this: Death, as the world defines it, is but an empty veil.**  
   **In Christ, ye are made alive, and through Him, ye shall never taste of death again.**

8. **Thus, I bear testimony to you all: The veil of death is torn asunder. In Christ, there is life eternal. And this truth, which is from the foundation of the world, shall endure forever.**

9. **By the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, the Redeemer of all souls, Amen.**
