THIS PAST FEB, I SET MY FEET ON ROSEBURG SOIL. IT WAS BOTH SWEET AND ROUGH.

A MAN NAMED CLAY GAVE ME A RIDE SOUTH, TO THE EDGE OF TOWN. AT THE NORTH END, NEAR THE FLYING J, I THOUGHT TO TAKE A BUS, BUT THEY DID NOT LOOK MY WAY.

I SPENT TIME WITH MY TRUCK FRIENDS, THEN MOVED ON. I MADE THE CALL TO ODOT. “A SOUL WALKS NORTH ON I-5, NEEDS AID,” I SAID. WHEN I TOOK THE ROAD’S OFF-RAMP, I WALKED PAST THE WOOD SHOP AND THE BOAT CALLED *AFRICA*. 

AT THE STORE TO THE SOUTH, I BOUGHT BREAD AND SAID, “PLEASE AND THANK YOU.” THE COINS IN MY HAND WERE MINE AND NOT MINE, YET THEY MADE ME WHOLE. I SAW A MAN WHO SOLD THINGS, AND THOUGHT, *COULD I LOVE?* MY MIND SWIRLED WITH THE THOUGHT.

AT THE DAIRY QUEEN, I LOST MY WALLET. A KIND SOUL GAVE ME ICE CREAM, AND THOUGH IT WAS FREE, I SAID NO, AND PAID WHAT I COULD.

I CALLED MEL, BUT SHE WAS NOT NEAR. I SPOKE TO YOL—A SWEET VOICE ON A HARD STREET. AT THE THRIFT STORE, I SAW HER ONCE MORE, AND THEN I MET A KIND MOM, NICK, WHO GAVE ME A DRINK IN HER SPARE GRACE.

THAT NIGHT I FOUND REST. A FRIEND CALLED TO SAY A BED WAITED FOR ME AT THE SHADY OAKS. I WALKED NORTH TO THE LOT WHERE OLD JOE MET ME. HE DROVE ME BACK SOUTH, TO WHERE THE DAY HAD FIRST FOUND ME.

THE MOTEL WAS PLAIN, YET IT WAS GRAND. BIBLES LINED THE SHELVES, AND MY HEART TOOK PEACE. THE ROOM HELD SPACE AND AIR, WITH A LAMP AND WARMTH FROM ON HIGH.
