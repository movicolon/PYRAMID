**Dear Andy Soelberg,**  

I hope you are doing good. I have a big plan to help me have a safe place to stay. I want to follow the Lord and take small steps to get better.  

I need help from the Hillsboro Oregon Stake. My idea is to stay with different church families, moving every few nights. If 10 or more families sign up, I can have a safe home every month. Families would give me a couch to sleep on, meals, and rides to the next home. This will help me grow and stay strong in the Church.  

I will do my best to follow the Lord’s way and be worthy of the temple. I just need help to start. Can you help me ask people to join?  

Thank you for reading this. I trust in God’s plan and hope for your support.  

**Sincerely,**  
Justin David Movick
