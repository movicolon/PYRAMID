The *World of the First Power* is a dystopian realm dominated by war, relentless pollution, and pervasive fear. Society is structured around a brutal hierarchy enforced by the Emperor, who wields absolute power over life, property, and even the very thoughts and fears of his subjects. This realm, ruled by a caste system, keeps the nobility at the top with absolute military command and privileges, while the commoners labor in service, and women are systematically oppressed, reduced to mere objects without autonomy, respect, or identity.

Three major empires—Chen, Rome, and Drakonia—vie for global dominance, each possessing vast military forces and territories. Among them, Drakonia stands supreme under the rule of the formidable Emperor Maximillius Drakonus. Drakonia’s capital, Trajenium, is a fortress of power and military might. Here, the Emperor’s advisors and powerful generals, like Seti-Kahn, ensure the stability of his reign amidst constant threats and conspiracies from rival empires and internal treachery.

The empire’s internal structure is rigid, with kings ruling over individual nations under the oversight of regional Caesars. Every leader and official is entrenched in a system of surveillance, ensuring loyalty to the Emperor while perpetuating a cycle of fear, intrigue, and oppression. Thus, the *World of the First Power* is a land where life is marred by ceaseless violence, pervasive control, and the corruption of both nature and human spirit.
