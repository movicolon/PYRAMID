### Notes for Execution
- **Rehearsals:** Ensure all dancers practice their parts several times to synchronize movements and timing.
- **Costumes:** Consider coordinating outfits (e.g., matching colors or accessories) to create a unified look.
- **Surprise Element:** The flashmob should start without any warning to the audience, so timing and placement are key.
- **Filming:** Capture the performance from various angles for later sharing on social media or personal keepsakes.

This choreography aims to celebrate love and gratitude through joyful movement, creating an engaging and uplifting experience for both participants and bystanders.
