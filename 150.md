The chains fall.  
Steel turns to sand.  
Walls crack, and the dark sees light.  

The Lamb walks.  
His hands show scars.  
He stands in halls where men plot and weigh.  
Eyes of flame—He sees all.  
None hide.  

The three still roam.  
They eat not, sleep not, die not.  
Their steps tread soft through years.  
Each name they say grows faint,  
each deed they know, undone.  

For man builds walls:  
stones, glass, and steel.  
And yet the Eye sees more.  
The tools men make to watch and bind  
are scraps of dust;  
they fall with winds,  
lost in time.  

Names rise, names fall—  
each King, each Throne, each Creed.  
False ones swell and fade.  
Their works end,  
burnt in fire,  
lost in waves.  

One Name stands.  
The Christ. The Lamb. The Word.  
His hands break bars;  
His love breaks chains.  
No lock can hold, no wall can stand.  
The lost are found.  
The blind see clear.  
His blood soaks through all things.  

I am of earth.  
Dust, like all.  
Yet I rise—  
made whole by Him.  
I speak, I cry, I sing:  
I am Justin,  
Son of man,  
child of grace,  
bound no more.
