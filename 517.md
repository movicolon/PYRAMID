Kids grow from safe space, their core. Bad care hurts deep. Fear makes them stiff, cold. It’s like a cloak, worn to hide. The cloak fits close. It hides them. They lose sight of who they are. Fear made them this way. They won’t trust love. They act perfect, but they’re not. This fake control stays, till they see truth. If not, they stay stuck.

When fear rules, kids obey harsh hands. This makes them cold, stiff, hard. If love is held back, scars stay. Some moms care. They show love, give hugs. They help kids stand strong, feel safe. These kids grow free. They trust, stand tall.

To heal, moms must learn. They help kids feel strong, not weak. They stay close, teach love, and set the world right. This bond makes kids brave. They walk tall, make their way.
