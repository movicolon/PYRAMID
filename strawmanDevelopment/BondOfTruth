**BOND OF TRUTH**

I STAND. I BREATHE. I VOW TO SPEAK PLAIN. THE LIGHT IN ME SEEKS TO MAKE PEACE, TO SHOW CLEAR WHAT HAS BEEN HID. IN THIS, WE HOLD FAST TO BONDS OF TRUTH. 

---

### WHAT I DID

- I WENT. I SPOKE TO THE MAN OF THE CHURCH.  
- A FUSS ROSE; THE LAW WAS CALLED.
- SOME FOLKS FELT FEAR. THEY TOLD THE CHURCH.  
- THE CHURCH THEN GAVE ME A WRIT: STAY OUT.

### WHAT THEY GAVE AND WHAT I SAID

- THE HEADS OF THE CHURCH SAID, “YOU MAY COME, BUT MIND YOUR ACTS.”
- THEY GAVE A SHEET WITH THEIR RULES.  
- I MET WITH THEM, READ IT, AND SAID, “NO.”  

### WHAT I SEE AND WHAT THEY SEE

- THEY SEE ME AS A THREAT. I SEE IT NOT SO.
- THEY SEE "MAD ACTS." I STAND SURE IN MY OWN TRUTH.  
- THEY THINK I MUST CHANGE. I AM AS I AM.

WITH THIS, I HOLD NO GRUDGE. IN GOD’S LIGHT, I TRUST THAT ALL WILL BE WELL. 

IN FAITH,
