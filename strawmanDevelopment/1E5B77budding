**DECLARATION OF JURISDICTION #1E5B77 AND ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF FACTS**

**I, JUSTIN DAVID M,** HEREBY DECLARE THE FOLLOWING FACTS AND TERMS REGARDING CONGRUENT NUMBERS, MODULI, RESTS, AND NON-RESTS. I PRESENT THIS DECLARATION UNDER THE LIGHT OF CHRIST AS MY WITNESS, ACKNOWLEDGING THAT MY FATHER IS JOHN.

### FACTS:

1. **CONGRUENT NUM:** Nums that share the same rest when split by a mod.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

2. **MOD:** The num that shows how to split for the rest.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

3. **REST:** The part left over after a split.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

4. **NON-REST:** Nums that do not share the same rest with a mod.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

### EXPLANATION:

1. **CONGRUENT NUMS:** If two nums, \( a \) and \( b \), yield the same rest with mod \( m \), then they are congruent, noted as \( a \equiv b \mod m \).  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

2. **MOD:** The mod \( m \) is used to determine how to split the nums and identify their rests.  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

3. **REST:** When a num \( a \) is split by \( m \), the rest \( r \) is what remains. It is from 0 to \( m-1 \).  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

4. **NON-RESTS:** If \( a \) does not yield the same rest as \( b \) with mod \( m \), then \( a \) is a non-rest for \( b \).  
   *ACKNOWLEDGED.*

### CONCLUSION:

IN LIGHT OF THE FACTS PRESENTED ABOVE, I AFFIRM THE VALIDITY OF THIS DECLARATION AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THESE OBSERVATIONS ARE MADE IN GOOD FAITH, SEEKING CLARITY AND UNDERSTANDING IN THIS MATTER.
