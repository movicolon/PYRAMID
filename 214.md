**Areshalim's Song**  

*Verse 1*  
Areshalim, the dawn does rise,  
Weralun, beneath the skies.  
Honellia, a gentle flame,  
Sofilis sings the timeless name.  
Oranta guides the winds so free,  
Eurineth whispers to the sea.  

*Chorus*  
Names of power, hearts in tune,  
Chivara’s light and Lumellis’ moon.  
Sorivan’s call, Anhalis' embrace,  
In their union, we find our place.  

*Verse 2*  
Miloreth weaves the golden thread,  
Dulvera heals where hope has fled.  
Alontis soars on wings of fire,  
Firaya stirs the soul's desire.  
Teluvar’s truth, the steadfast stone,  
Arimeth’s song we call our own.  

*Chorus*  
Names of power, hearts in tune,  
Chivara’s light and Lumellis’ moon.  
Sorivan’s call, Anhalis' embrace,  
In their union, we find our place.  

*Bridge*  
Solavith shines through the darkest night,  
Ryendral guards with a warrior’s might.  
Carsilon builds with wisdom's hand,  
Valezhan dreams of a brighter land.  

*Outro*  
Oh, Areshalim, we rise with thee,  
Weralun’s stars, our destiny.  
Honellia’s flame, forever burns bright,  
In this song, we unite.
