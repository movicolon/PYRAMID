**THIS one represent | Book of Sariah, Ch. 19**  

1. Sariah spoke: “God’s hush feels sharp. But is God mute? Or is it man’s heart that lacks stillness?”  

2. Pride blinds, bends truth. Words meant for gain miss God.  

3. The self swells, fills the void. No space left for God’s calm.  

4. The rush of life drowns the soft song.  

5. Some seek God’s voice for spite. They mock, scorn, and turn away.  

6. Others doubt, filled with gloom, call themselves unworthy.  

7. Yet a few stay still, give no blame. They shine, a light for all.  

8. Faith grows slow. Through acts, through care, through hope.  

9. God speaks not in storm but in the calm. Seek and hear.  

10. Pray oft. Make still the soul. Feel the breath of God in wind, in bird song.  

11. Faith grows when time is given, when trust is sure.  

12. Cast hate far. Love fills the space God seeks.  

13. In the hush, God waits. Be still.

: the perceived silence of God is not a lack of speech but a failure to listen, compounded by pride, doubt, and busyness. Faith requires stillness, prayer, and love.
